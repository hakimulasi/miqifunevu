Confession: There are days when we fall asleep with a full face of makeup still intact. If a missed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">face cleanse</a>&nbsp;happens occasionally, it’s likely not too damaging — but routinely clogged pores cause dullness, acne and more.</p><p>Makeup wipes are a fairly solid solution for these moments, but they’re not as effective as a full wash. If you find yourself missing your nighttime routine, make your life easier by picking up <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this cleansing stick</a> from Jones Street! It’s a much more impactful way to make sure your complexion is clean and clear, and it also boasts a slew of advantages we absolutely love. Read on for the scoop!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Cleansing Stick</a> face wash for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Jones Road!</strong></p><p>Many cleansers come in a bottle or other type of container which requires a pump, thanks to the liquid consistency. But with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this stick</a>, you’re snagging an entirely different experience! Its formula contains sunflower seed oil and other naturally-derived ingredients that are beneficial for your skin and can cleanse it equally well as a soapier product.</p><p>That’s the other amazing thing about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this cleansing stick</a> — it’s not as drying as other face washes on the market. If you tend to have dry skin and don’t want to feel that tight sensation after washing your face, this product was built for you! All you have to do is apply the stick onto dry skin and then use your hands to emulsify the cleanser with water and lather up. Rub it in, rinse and then you’re all set!</p><p><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Cleansing Stick</a> face wash for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Jones Road!</strong></p><p>Another amazing quality of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this cleansing stick</a> is that it’s travel-friendly. As it’s a solid and not a liquid, you don’t have to worry about having to ditch it while going through airport security! No need to check your luggage when this cleanser is in your carry-on. You may think it’s slightly odd to apply this stick over makeup, but fear not: Shoppers say it’s simpler than ever to wipe your face free from foundation, concealer and more. This stick won’t strip your skin of any moisture, so you can maintain and boost your radiance in one quick step. We absolutely adore the concept of this powerful product, and so many reviewers say it’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">their absolute favorite cleanser</a> to date!</p><p><strong>See it: Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Cleansing Stick</a> face wash for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Jones Road!</strong></p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
