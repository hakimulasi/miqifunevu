This figure is relatively modest when compared to his peers from the classic sitcom <strong>Good Times</strong>.</p><p>For instance, <strong>John Amos</strong>, who played the stern patriarch James Evans, reportedly has a net worth of around $300 thousand. Similarly, <strong>Bern Nadette Stanis</strong>, famed for her role as Thelma Evans, has accumulated a net worth of approximately $6 million, significantly higher than Walker’s.</p><p>Even <strong>Ralph Carter</strong>, who played the youngest Evans child, Michael, boasts a net worth of about $1 million. <strong>Esther Rolle</strong>, who starred as the beloved matriarch Florida Evans, had amassed wealth similar to Stanis before her passing in 1998.</p><p>These comparisons highlight the financial disparities among the cast members, despite their shared early fame.</p><h2><span id=Jimmie-Walker-Full-Overview-and-Wiki>Jimmie Walker Full Overview and Wiki</span></h2><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rachelparris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jimmie-Walker-Full-Overview-and-Wiki.jpg decoding=async alt="Jimmie Walker Full Overview and Wiki" width=800 height=533 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span id=The-Impact-of-Good-Times-on-His-Career-and-Net-Worth>The Impact of Good Times on His Career and Net Worth</span></h3><p>Good Times not only catapulted Walker to fame but also established him financially during its run.
