We are here today to change that, and present the thirteen best smelling shampoos for men in 2023 that can be found on the market right now.</p><h3>The Smell of Success</h3><p>The scent left behind by shampoo often lingers on your hair and will follow you throughout the day, especially for those who come into close contact with you.<br>People make unconscious decisions about an individual’s suitability for a certain role or relationship based on subtle scent cues more often than most people realize, whether in business or in a personal capacity.</p><p>To maximize your success in life you should choose the best smelling shampoo you can find – whilst still using a product that works to meet the needs of your hair and scalp.</p><h3>Aromatherapy</h3><p>A great smelling shampoo can also add of course to your overall shower experience, acting as a small dose of aromatherapy, filling up the shower and blending with the steam.</p><p>Showers are a great place to reset your mood, whether you need to revive and uplift, gaining energy for the day ahead, or to unwind, relax, and wash away stress.</p><p>Reflect upon what time of day you typically wash your hair and consider matching your shampoo scent profile to your needs. The right aromatherapy match can really amplify the desired change in your mood and energy levels.</p><p>For example, bright and sharp scents such as fruits, citrus, spices and minty herbals are a great choice for energizing. In contrast, warm and earthy tones are suited to unwinding – so think of using musks or calming florals for example.</p><h3>A Scent for Every Man</h3><p>Aromatherapy matching aside, there are also, of course, the requirements that come from personal preference. It is your shower and your experience – so first and foremost you should love the scent.</p><p>Far be it from us to assume there is a one-size-fits-all ‘masculine’ smell that is the best option for all men. Instead, we present to you a variety of options that cover the full range of perfumery notes.</p><p>Some are warm, musky and sweet, others are fruity and floral. More still, we offer options that are herbal or minty, and have some that cut through with a refreshing sharp citrus.</p><p>Read on for our list of the 13 best smelling shampoos for men in 2023 to find the pick that is perfect for you.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Coconut Apricot Shampoo</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image13-2-1.png><p>Scent: Sweet, fruity, tropical</p><p>The dichotomous enigma from Blu Atlas – The Coconut Apricot Shampoo – tops our list.</p><p>Powerful forces of opposition work throughout this formula to meet almost any of your hair needs and scent desires, in a product designed especially for men.</p><h3>The Scent</h3><p>First of all the main scents – apricot and coconut. This combination of sweet and fruity tones makes this an appropriate choice for the man who wants the flexibility to be able to apply this product day or night. The warm tones are calming, whilst the tropical fruits will gently uplift.</p><h3>Powerful Dichotomy</h3><p>Another dichotomy comes in the strength of this formula, as it is powerful in its cleaning, hair growth promotion, and shine and strengthening properties, but is also more than gentle enough to be used daily.</p><p>This is reflected in its balance of using 99% natural ingredients that are better for you and the planet, whilst still being firmly grounded in scientific research and dermatological efficacy.</p><p>We love the use of vegan biotin to fortify hair strands. We also love the inclusion of saw palmetto to resist hair loss – a compound that can help counteract DHT, a naturally produced hormone in your skin associated with hair loss.</p><p>Aloe Leaf is also included for its calming, antioxidant and moisturizing properties.</p><p>Lastly, we nod to the inclusion of the mighty jojoba oil, which is simply packed with hair goodness – from powerful antioxidants and nourishing and strengthening fatty acids, to those hair loving vitamins A, D and E. Your hair will never be the same after this shampoo!</p><h3>Bonus</h3><p>Best of all, we love the comfort of the full money-back guarantee that Blu Atlas offers, an offer that makes the decision to try a new product easier on the pocket and the mind.</p><p>Blu Atlas also offers their shampoo in a classic scent option.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hunter Lab Invigorating Shampoo</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image9-4-1.png><p>Scent: Rosemary, Citrus, Minty</p><p>Those looking for a sharp injection of energy in the morning will love number two on our list of the best smelling shampoos in 2023, the Invigorating Shampoo from Hunter Lab.</p><p>This shampoo has a complex and layered scent profile, good for a man with multiplicity to his personality.</p><h3>The Scent</h3><p>The scent in this shampoo starts with a sharp citrus hit from grapefruit peel. This is followed by the classic and strong pick-me-up smell of peppermint, rounded out by the sweet herbal, rosemary. These notes are supported by basil and geranium.</p><h3>Beauty and Botanicals</h3><p>We love this balance of well-known hair-loving ingredients, with Australian native botanicals. On the established end we have hemp oil, the all-natural hair superstar, along with silk proteins to create healthy strands and shine.</p><p>Australian botanicals include quandong, desert lime, and wattle seed extracts which work wonders for your scalp and hair in a variety of ways, including cleansing, strength building and nourishment.</p><p>The design of this bottle is also sharp and sophisticated, a product the woman or man in your life will be proud to display in the bathroom. It oozes elegance whilst anchoring deeply into the masculine energies.</p><p>If you’re looking to get up and go in the morning, and are a fan of natural ingredients, we recommend this elegant and complex product offering from Hunter Labs.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Oribe Gold Lust Repair and Restore Shampoo</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image5-4-1.png><p>Scent: Amber, fruity, sandalwood</p><p>If you are a high-end, high-flying man, who loves to ooze charisma and seduce, this luxurious offering may be the perfect shampoo for you. It is also on the restorative end of scent profiles.</p><p>Number three on our list of the best smelling shampoos in 2023 is the Oribe Gold Lust Repair and Restore Shampoo – a powerful object of desire that will impart its seductive influence on you.</p><h3>The Scent</h3><p>As appropriate for such purposes, this shampoo has a deeply heady scent, grounded in earthy, musky, and warm tones that both puts one at ease and simmers gently in the corners of the psyche, hinting at something more.</p><h3>Complex Restoration</h3><p>This shampoo is not all about the aesthetic and sensory appeal however, it is also packed with complexes and extracts to rejuvenate hair that is dry, damaged, or just to add an overall lift.</p><p>The first such complex is the Oribe signature complex, which contains watermelon, lychee, and edelweiss flower extracts to add protection against damage from the environment and from hair deterioration over time.</p><p>Another is their bio-restorative complex, which contains plant collagen, vitamin B3, and caffeine to strengthen hair, energize the scalp, and perform deep nourishment at the root. This works alongside an amino acid complex to rebuild broken strands and moisturize.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough, this formula also has the luxurious argan oil for smoothing and damage prevention, alongside Mediterranean cypress extract for deep repair and restoration.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bed Head for Men Clean Up Daily Shampoo</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image1-4-1.png><p>Scent: Fresh, Peppermint, Basil</p><p>Looking for a shampoo that commands you to wake up, sort out that bed hair, and make you presentable to seize the day?</p><p>You’ll love number four on our list of the best smelling shampoos for men in 2023 – the Clean Up Daily Shampoo from Bed Head For Men.</p><h3>The Scent</h3><p>This blend is commanded by two sharp and strong herbals, basil and peppermint. These are fantastic scents for washing away the grogginess of the morning and kicking you into action. It is time to “Clean Up” your act!</p><h3>Put Bedhead to Rest</h3><p>To help greet the day, this formula contains sunflower seed oil, a lightweight oil that nourishes the strand without weighing it down. This ensures that the shampoo does not dry out the hair when cleaning it of any debris.</p><p>To aid in the battle against hair loss, this formula also contains serenoa serrulata fruit extract. This is a super concentrated and purified form of the saw palmetto berry, which counteracts a naturally produced hormone in the skin associated with increased hair fall.</p><p>Rest comforted that TIGI is owned by Unilever, the home and body conglomerate that has established and effective processes of quality control and assurance.</p><h3>5. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Art of Sport Men’s Shampoo and Conditioner Compete</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image7-4-1.png><p>Scent: Citrus, Pear, Energizing</p><p>If you are a man interested in sport, whether as an avid supporter or active participant, you’ll love this next offering.</p><p>Number five on our list of the best smelling shampoos for men in 2023 is the Complete Men’s Shampoo and Conditioner by Art of Sport.</p><h3>The Scent</h3><p>An energizing lift is needed for the sporting man, whether to provide that motivation to go out and train, or to scrub clean that sweaty proof of effort that weighs down your hair after sporting activities.</p><p>The perfect match for such needs is this uplifting, citrus-heavy scent profile, with the support of the simultaneously sweet and sour notes carried by pear. This will help you compete and complete your sports to your high levels of expectation.</p><h3>The Sporting Man</h3><p>No sporting man has time to mess around, that’s why we love the time-saver of having a shampoo and conditioner rolled into one. We also love the complete lack of nasties – no sulfates, parabens, or phthalates.</p><p>This selection uses the soothing, anti-dandruff properties of witch hazel, which also fights greasy hair, common after exercise, whilst also reducing hair loss. After this deep-cleansing treatment, the coconut oil deeply nourishes and strengthens the hair.</p><p>And if you’ve reached the finish line and are looking to cool off and celebrate that victory, consider the AOS Victory shampoo, which switches out that energizing citrus with a cooling and healing eucalyptus smell.</p><h3>6. Aesop Shampoo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image4-3-1.png><p>Scent: Earthy, woody, citrus</p><p>If you’re more of the refined and cool-headed minimalist man looking for inspiration, this next pick on our list may be the perfect shampoo for you.</p><p>Number six on our list is the simply-named Shampoo from Aesop.</p><h3>The Scent</h3><p>This blend is earthy and woody, with a sparkling top note of citrus, taking you back to the mountains, into your cabin in the woods. Just how the woods are both soothing to the soul and rejuvenating, experience a similar enlivening of the senses with this shampoo.</p><h3>Refined and Deliberate</h3><p>Three luxurious ingredients stand out in this shampoo: the rind from bergamot, deeply aromatic frankincense, and warming cedar atlas. Bergamot is a great stimulator of new hair growth, whilst frankincense adds shine and moisture, with great dandruff prevention.</p><p>Cedar atlas is a gentle anti-inflammatory, helping out with any tender skin conditions, and joining in on the hair loss prevention and dandruff actions of the prior two ingredients.</p><p>Aesop approaches all its range with a quiet and deliberate approach, creating products that are unassuming yet powerful.
