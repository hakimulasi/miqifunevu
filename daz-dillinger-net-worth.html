Dillinger is best known for his membership in the duo Tha Dogg Pound, alongside Kurupt, as well as for his work with Death Row Records.</p><p>Delmar Drew Arnaud (aka Daz Dillinger and fka Dat Nigga Daz) was born May 15, 1973 and hails from Los Angeles, California. He has worked alongside some of the West Coast's best rappers. Along with Kurupt, <a href=# title="Nate Dogg Net Worth">Nate Dogg</a>, and <a href=# title="Snoop Dogg Net Worth">Snoop Dogg</a>, Dillinger was one of the Long Beach clique that had been introduced to <a href=# title="Dr Dre Net Worth">Dr. Dre</a> through <a href=# title="Warren G Net Worth">Warren G</a> during the preliminary stages of the legendary Chronic album. Though Dillinger played only a minor role in the success of that album, his subsequent contributions to Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle album as a rapper quickly established him as an up-and-coming West Coast talent. He was even chosen to be Dr. Dre's successor for the production of Snoop's Tha Doggfather album. Around the same time, he was part of a duo also including Kurupt, known as Tha Dogg Pound, that released a somewhat overlooked album, Dogg Food. Following the departure of Dr. Dre, the death of 2Pac and the imprisonment of <a href=# title="Suge Knight Net Worth">Suge Knight</a>, Death Row lost its momentum and Dillinger's career with it. During the late '90s, he continued his efforts as a producer, but saw his solo album for Death Rowâ€”Retaliation, Revenge & Get Backâ€”get continually pushed back until it was finally released in 1998 to an indifferent audience. The album did feature In California, which proved to be a minor hit.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-330722 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/daz-dillinger.jpg alt="Daz Dillinger Net Worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-330722 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Leon Bennett/WireImage)</p><p>In 2000, Dillinger released his second album, R.A.W. on his Dogg Pound Records label. On this record, Dillinger dissed Suge Knight, Death Row and even his cousin Snoop Dogg. Without major-label push, however, the album was quietly received. When Kurupt announced his new position as vice president of Death Row Records in 2002, Daz cut all ties with his former partner. This distance between the two lasted until 2005 when the duo joined forces once again for the Dogg Pound album Cali Iz Active. A year later, Daz signed with <a href=# title="Jermaine Dupri Net Worth">Jermaine Dupri</a>'s So So Def label and released So So Gangsta. In September 2018, Daz was arrested at his home 20 miles outside of Atlanta on multiple felony charges. Police found 117 grams of marijuana, 10 THC pods, THC oil and a vaporizor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX5muu3nDoqOloZ6csrN5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dwts-witney-carson-husband-carson-mcallister-welcome-1st-child.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DWTS Witney Carson, Husband Carson McAllister Welcome 1st Child</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dakota-fanning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Dakota Fanning Is In for An Extensive Dating Game with Her Boyfriends Throughout the Years</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
