Despite their humble beginnings, they instilled in their daughter the importance of hard work and determination. These values have served Ramyr well throughout her life.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Ramyr attended college where she studied business administration. It was during her time in college that she met her future husband, Daym Drops. The two hit it off immediately and were married shortly after graduation.</p><p>Since then, Ramyr has been a stay-at-home mom to their two children. In her spare time, she enjoys cooking, baking, and spending time with her family.

Furthermore, food reviewer Daymon Patterson is a well-known figure who rose to prominence after uploading a number of exceptional films to YouTube under his stage moniker Daym Drops.</p><p>Daym’s debut viral video, a review of Five Guys Burgers and Fries in 2012, was the harbinger of a viral song that swept the internet in 2013.

Ramyr’s marital status with Daym has not been in the news recently, but she has remained an unknown figure until now.

Ramyr has been an unwavering supporter of her husband’s professional ambitions, and she has remained by his side throughout his highs and lows. Daym and Ramyr also knew one another before Daym’s rise to culinary acclaim. In a similar vein, the pair married in 2012 in a brief but beautiful ceremony that was later aired on Daym’s YouTube channel.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=daym-drops-divorces-his-wife-ramyr-gonzales></span>Daym Drops Divorces His Wife: Ramyr Gonzales<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ramyr Gonzales’ age has become the most discussed issue of the day.
