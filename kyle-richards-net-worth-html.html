But just how much is Richards’s worth?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-richards-held-the-throne-for-the-wealthiest-cast-member-until-her-sister-s-arrival><strong>Richards held the throne for the wealthiest cast member until her sister’s arrival</strong></h2><p id=par-3_57>Aside from acting, Richards is also an influential businesswoman with several clothing lines, such as NYFW. Ever since she joined RHOBH, Richards’s net worth has increased significantly. Her business ventures and acting career have earned her an impressive net worth. Although <a href=#>Richards’ net worth</a> is in the millions, many publications usually combine her wealth alongside her husband’s.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_59>Richards’ husband Mauricio Umansky is a celebrated property agent. He has been involved with various high-selling properties such as the Playboy Mansion and Walt Disney Estate through his real estate firm, The Agency. He has also sold properties to multiple celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Prince. With a combined wealth estimation, <a href=#>Richards is worth a whopping $100 million</a>.</p><p id=par-5_61>However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Richard’s sister is worth a lot more with a net worth of $350 million which is primarily thanks to her tycoon husband, Ricky Hilton of the Hilton hotels. Hilton owns a real estate agency, Hilton & Hyland, with an impressive $85 million sale of the largest residential sale in Los Angeles, the Candy Spelling estate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-the-other-housewives-rank><strong>How the other Housewives rank</strong></h2><p id=par-6_44>When put in comparison with other cast members, Richards’s net worth seems monstrous. However, other cast members are also <a href=#>equally wealthy</a>, although not nearly as rich as Hilton or Richards. Dorit Kemsley has a combined net worth of $50 million with her husband P.K.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_57>Lisa Rinna ties in with Garcelle Beauvais with an estimated net worth of about $8 million, while Erika Jayne is reportedly worth $15 million. Erika has recently found herself in legal entanglements and a pending divorce which might foreseeably alter her financial status. Crystal Minkoff and her director husband have an estimated net worth of $16 million.</p><p id=par-8_52>Sutton Stracke probably has the least wealth of all the women, with sources reporting that she sits at around $2 million. Although when compared to other people, it may seem a lot, Stracke’s net worth is far less than her cast members and a far cry from Rinna’s statement about Stracke’s finances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-richards-started-as-a-child-actor><strong>Richards started as a child actor</strong></h2><p id=par-9_54>Richards was born in Los Angeles in January 1969 to Kenneth Edwin and Kathleen Mary Richards, who named her after Kyle Rote of the New York Giants. Richards’ parents separated in 1972, and her mother remarried twice more. Richards has five half-siblings, two of whom are well known to the public, Kathy and Kim.</p><p id=par-10_40>The reality star began acting in 1974 with Little House On The Prairie. Kim and Richards appeared on screen together in the 1977 film The Car. Throughout the ’70s Richards enjoyed success with Flying High, Fantasy Island, and Carter Country.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_53>Since then, Richards has appeared in various productions like The Watcher In The Woods, ER as Nurse Dori Kerns, Deadly Sibling Rivalry, The Hungover Games, Love Boat, CSI, City Guys, Seventh Heaven and Beverly Hills,90210. Richards joined the <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> in 2010 and has stayed with the show since then.</p><p id=par-12_44>Additionally, the actor executive produced American Woman, a Paramount Network comedy series based loosely on her childhood. As of 2021, Richards is slated to appear in Halloween Kills, reprising her role as Lindsey Wallace. She will also appear in the Real Housewives All-Stars spinoff.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4urjEZqmim5iWv6W%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tasha-smith-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Tasha Smith Net Worth 2024: Unveiling Her Financial Success</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julie-kim-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Julie Kim Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
