Like, who spends that kind of money on a kid? [My daughter] was one when [Samantha] took my baby from me.</p><p>“We never spent $20,000 a month on our child and the credit card was wide open, so what the fuck do you suddenly need that kind of money for?”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a lengthy caption attached to the social media video, the <a class=underline-link href=#>TGT</a> vocalist went into detail about how he’s made several attempts at pushing back against the legal proceedings that he is convicted have been biased against him thus far.</p><p>Check it out below:</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Tyrese is currently requesting a new judge in his ongoing divorce case</a>, suggesting that the one currently presiding over it is prejudiced against him. According to a TMZ report last week, he filed a motion in court alleging Judge Kevin M. Farmer abruptly canceled a hearing that would have allowed him to tell his side of the story before having to fork over a $450,000 bond.</p><p>Instead, he was ordered to come up with the six-figure sum in just 10 days. His plan was to use the hearing to explain why he couldn’t pay the money because of the <a class=underline-link href=#>Hollywood strikes</a>.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/tyrese-ex-wife-takes-accountability-for-ugly-and-messy-divorce-250x142.jpg alt="Tyrese’s Ex-Wife Takes ‘Accountability’ For ‘Ugly & Messy’ Divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Tyrese’s Ex-Wife Takes ‘Accountability’ For ‘Ugly & Messy’ Divorce</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 30, 2023</p></a><p>This isn’t the first time the Fast & Furious actor has taken issue with Judge Farmer. Days before a court hearing earlier this year (the results of which he was trying to appeal with this latest court date), <a class=underline-link href=#>he blasted the judge for being “racist” and accused him of calling his ex-wife a “bitch”</a> in the private chambers of his office. He also accused the judge of illegally sealing the case to cover up his own misconduct.</p><p>“We tried to get him recused, we tried to get him thrown off the bench because of his conduct and his unprofessionalism. And then there were a bunch of things pertaining to the outcome of my case that he did that was literally illegal,” Tyrese said in an Instagram post.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Tyrese and Farmer’s issues date back to last August, when <a class=underline-link href=#>the Fulton County jurist threatened to hold him in contempt of court</a> for arguing with his ex-wife’s lawyer over his earnings. At that hearing, the Transformers&nbsp;star was ordered to pay over $10,000 a month in child support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirsqqVqLJuv8uapKxlla16uLXFnmRraJtisKm1y51krK2gpbyzwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vidal-sassoon-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vidal Sassoon Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-queen-favourite-chocolate-biscuit-cake-recipe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Queen eats a slice of this cake every day try her favourite recipe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
