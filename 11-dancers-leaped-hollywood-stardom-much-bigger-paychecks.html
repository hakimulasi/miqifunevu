She took daily ballet, modern, and jazz classes.&nbsp; After moving back to the US, she shifted her focus to musical theater.&nbsp; She landed her first major role in the 2000 film, "Center Stage".&nbsp; The movie was about, what else, struggling ballet dancers.&nbsp; It was only up from there.&nbsp; Her net worth as an actress is currently $14 million.</p><p><strong>Lea Thompson</strong></p><p>Salary as a Dancer:&nbsp; approx. $600 per week</p><p>Salary as an Actor:&nbsp; approx. <strong>$25,000 per episode</strong> for her series, "Switched at Birth"</p><p><a href=#>Lea Thompson</a> made it to the big time in the world of dance.&nbsp;

From there, she danced in multiple companies – including Pennsylvania Ballet, Minnesota Dance Theatre, Ballet Repertory, and American Ballet Theatre.&nbsp; She was considered a dancer to watch.&nbsp; Then famed dancer,&nbsp; <a href=# title="Mikhail Baryshnikov Net Worth">Mikhail Baryshnikov</a>, who was then the artistic director of American Ballet Theatre, told her that her body type was wrong.&nbsp; "Beautiful dancer, but too stocky", he said.&nbsp; She shifted her focus to acting and went on to earn legions of fans in film and television projects like "Back to the Future", "All the Right Moves", "Some Kind of Wonderful", and the hit sitcom, "Caroline in the City".&nbsp; Her net worth as an actress is $14 million.</p><p><strong>Mia Wasikowksa</strong></p><p>Salary as a Dancer:&nbsp; approx. 600 Australian Dollars per week ($550 US)</p><p>Salary as an Actor:&nbsp; approx <strong>$2,000,000 per film</strong></p><p>Like Lea Thompson, <a href=# title="Mia Wasikowska Net Worth">Mia Wasikowska</a> started dancing as a child and showed real talent early on.&nbsp; By age thirteen she was going to school full-time and dancing as much as 35 hours per week.&nbsp; However, bone spurs and the pressure to be perfect finally proved to be too daunting.&nbsp; She chose to shift her focus to acting while she was in high school, and began working almost immediately.&nbsp; She broke out appearing on the series, "In Treatment" in 2008.&nbsp; She has since starred in such films as "Defiance", "Amelia", "Alice in Wonderland", "The Kids Are Alright", "Jane Eyre", and "Stoker", and has projects lined up through 2015.</p><p><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></p><p>Salary as a Dancer/Actor: 550 GBP per week (approx. $900 US)</p><p>Salary as a Film Actor:&nbsp; <strong>$10,000,000 per film</strong></p><p>Before she was a big deal movie star married to fellow actor <a href=# title="Michael Douglas Net Worth">Michael Douglas</a>, <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> was a musical theater darling.&nbsp; She began training to be a triple threat when she was a child, and went on to dance, sing, and act in professional productions of "Annie", "Bugsy Malone", "The Pajama Game", "42nd Street", and the opera, "Street Scene", among other projects.&nbsp; She shifted her focus to acting for film in the early 90s, and subsequently took Hollywood by storm.&nbsp; However, she has since returned to her musical theater roots to great acclaim, winning an Oscar for her performance in the film version of "Chicago", and a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway revival of "A Little Night Music".&nbsp;

She spent nine years totally focused on the art form, going on to land a spot at Spain's prestigious National Conservatory.&nbsp; She spent three years there and went on to study theater in New York.&nbsp; By her mid-teens, however, she had realized that acting might be more her calling, and she shifted her focus.&nbsp; She booked work almost immediately, first gaining notice when she was hired to host the teen Spanish talk show, "La Quinta Marcha", when she was sixteen.&nbsp; She has gone on to a very busy career in both the US and Spain, and won an Oscar and a BAFTA for her work in "Vicky Cristina Barcelona".&nbsp; Like Catherine Zeta-Jones, she also returned to her dance roots recently, performing a standout number in the movie musical, "Nine".&nbsp;

Amazingly, she's not trained in martial arts!&nbsp; Instead, the actress is an accomplished dancer, who began studying dance when she was in elementary school.&nbsp; She went on to study at the prestigious Beijing Dance Academy, and subsequently won the National Youth Dance Championship.&nbsp; However, instead of parlaying her win into a dance company job, she turned it into work in television commercials.&nbsp; She subsequently graduated from the Central Academy of Drama, and has been working steadily in film projects in Asia and the US ever since.&nbsp;

<strong>$500,000+ per film</strong></p><p>Jamie Bell became familiar to audiences with his heartbreaking turn in the hit movie, "Billy Elliott", about a boy from a small town with big-time dance dreams.&nbsp; The story was not that far from his own.&nbsp; He grew up in a family of dancers, and began dancing in the hallway outside of his sister's dance classes when he was little.&nbsp; Eventually he started his own dance training, both in ballet and tap, but hid it from his circle of friends.&nbsp; His life as a dancer eventually became less of a secret, when he began winning national and international tap competitions.&nbsp; He subsequently chose to shift his focus to acting.&nbsp; He got his start in musical theater, and then won the title role in "Billy Elliott" out of 2000 young actors.&nbsp;

Following in the footsteps of his mother, an actress turned drama teacher, and his siblings, all of whom were performers, John Travolta first worked in musical theater.&nbsp; He dropped out of high school to focus on performing, and landed his first gig in the professional touring company of "Grease". (The film version of which he would later star in.) &nbsp;He then appeared on Broadway in the show, "Over Here!".&nbsp; However, Hollywood was where he wanted to be. &nbsp;He left the New York musical theater world behind and went off to make movies.&nbsp; His career has had its ups and downs.&nbsp; Interestingly, the projects that have been most successful, often feature him dancing.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; His current net worth is $165 million.</p><p><strong>Alexander Gudonov</strong></p><p>Salary as a Dancer:&nbsp; $5,500 per week (ABT Principal)</p><p>Salary as an Actor:&nbsp; <strong>$250,000</strong></p><p>Alexander Gudonov was a very famous ballet dancer worldwide when he defected to the United States in the late 70s.&nbsp; He began dancing when he was nine at the Riga State Ballet School.&nbsp; His classmate (and future boss) was Mikhail Baryshnikov.&nbsp; He went on to work as a principal dancer with such world-renowned companies as the Moscow Classical Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet, and American Ballet Theater.&nbsp; He began his acting career after Mikhail Baryshnikov controversially fired him from American Ballet Theater in 1982.&nbsp; He earned rave reviews for his work in his debut film, "Witness", and then became an audience favorite with his performance as Karl, a villain in "Die Hard".&nbsp; However, his career was tragically short-lived.&nbsp; He passed away in 1995.</p><p>This list is made up of contemporary actors.&nbsp; In old Hollywood, being an actor, singer, dancer was a requirement.&nbsp; If you couldn't do all three when a studio signed you, they made sure you could do all three by the time you shot your first film.&nbsp; <a href=# title="Gene Kelly Net Worth">Gene Kelly</a>, <a href=# title="Danny Kaye Net Worth">Danny Kaye</a>, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Cyd Cherise, Donald O'Connor, <a href=# title="Judy Garland Net Worth">Judy Garland</a>, Howard Keel, <a href=# title="Chita Rivera Net Worth">Chita Rivera</a>, <a href=# title="Rita Moreno Net Worth">Rita Moreno</a>, and Ann-Margret are just a few of the actors and actresses who could truly do it all.&nbsp; <a href=# title="Audrey Hepburn Net Worth">Audrey Hepburn</a> couldn't sing, but she was an accomplished ballet dancer, and part of her allure came from the poise she learned in the dance studio.&nbsp; Those days are mostly gone now.&nbsp; However, over the last decade there has been a resurgence in the popularity of movie musicals and dance movies, so maybe we'll begin seeing more and more actors with dance chops on screen.&nbsp; Here's hoping.&nbsp; All those dancers out there need to eat and <strong>pay the rent</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJoaGpllJa7pLHRrGSlnZGlsqV5x6ijpbGnpLyledKtmKucn6J6rsHCoWSboZecsrN5z5qwnKCVmLi0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./annika-backes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Annika Backes Bio, Age, Facts, Family Life of Tistos Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andre-berto-video-best-breasts-hollywood.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andre Berto -- The Best Breasts In Hollywood Belong To ...</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
