The crux of the matter was their alleged hand-holding.</p><p>It had piqued the curiosity of many, especially considering Mauricio’s separation from his wife, <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=438>Kyle Richards</a>.</p><p>In response to the speculations, Mauricio stated, “We do want to address this story, this whole thing that’s going out and about, about whether Emma and I are dating.” He quickly clarified, “To be completely clear, we are not dating.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Clarifying the Relationship Rumors</strong></h2><p>Emma joined in, reaffirming, “We’re not dating.” The two emphasized their strong friendship, explaining that they had been dancing together for six weeks, practicing for four hours a day, every single day. The rigorous routine had brought them close, creating a special bond.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mauricio-Umansky-and-Emma-Slater-Deny-Dating-Rumors.jpg><p>Emma shared, “As though a truly unique bond is formed between you. Our relationship is very supportive, and I believe that our personalities are similar. We support one another without a doubt. It is also really lovely, which is wonderful.”</p><p>Mauricio took it a step further by providing a more detailed account of the moment that had sparked the rumors. He explained that after a rehearsal session, they had gone to a restaurant to enjoy sushi.</p><p>They were still in their rehearsal attire. He explained, saying, “A lot of the tales are false. And yes, this has been a very emotional week.</p><p>We were reminiscing after supper when I reached out to grab Emma’s hand, and she grabbed mine.” Mauricio clarified that the paparazzi had captured this moment, and it had been blown out of proportion.</p><p>The pictures of Mauricio and Emma holding hands had previously prompted Kyle Richards, Mauricio’s estranged wife, to express how difficult she found it to look at. On October 25, she had gone on “Watch What Happens Live” and said it had wounded her feelings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mauricio-Umansky-and-Emma-Slater.jpg><p>According to her, “it was pretty hard to see.” “It hurt my feelings. We are friendly, and I really do love him, but that really did hurt me. I am not sure if anything has happened yet, but clearly something is wrong there.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kyle Richards’ Heartfelt Response</strong></h2><p>Following their July announcement that they were divorcing after 27 years of marriage, <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=439>Mauricio Umansky</a> and Kyle have now announced their continued separation.</p><p>Even though they encountered a number of difficulties, they remained dedicated to getting through them. They were still working through their marriage, and Mauricio emphasized that they were not divorced.</p><p>This real-life drama is about to begin, and amid conjecture, the truth comes to light.</p><p>Mauricio and Emma have corrected the record for the time being, highlighting the value of friendship and the special bond that develops during the demanding journey of “Dancing with the Stars.”</p><p>From behind the scenes to onstage, the entertainment industry never stops surprising us with new turns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kwbd7zJqsq6GTnrxuwcyapayjqWKur7CMnqSmmV2ouaLAxKtkmpyUp7K0v4yrpqaZnpiybr7Upqarq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-che-pranks-shocked-colin-jost-on-snl-by-convincing-audience-not-to-laugh-at-his-jokes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Che Pranks Shocked Colin Jost on 'SNL' by Convincing Audience Not to Laugh at His Jokes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./luis-valbuena-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Luis Valbuena Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
