She says that she likes to bring healthy options with her. "Sets are literally the worst place on the planet for willpower. There's donuts everywhere. There's candy everywhere. There's Doritos everywhere. It's really hard to eat healthy, and I think that's part of the reason I've been trying to set aside time to cook more and prepare more food that I can bring with me."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_1043640091.jpg><p><span>Jesse Lee Soffer talked about his favorite workouts with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Men's Journal</span></a><span>. He says that he does German Volume Training. </span><span>"You're doing 10 sets of a few different exercises, 10 reps each, but at lower weights," Soffer explains. "Right now I'm doing a 5/10/15 program where I start off going heavy for five reps. On the next exercise, I do 10 reps at a medium weight, and then by the end of this superset, I'm on 15 reps of light weight. I can barely get through it."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_1705156879.jpg><p><span>Patrick John Flueger talked about the process of working on </span><i><span>Chicago P.D.</span></i><span> to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>UsWeekly</span></a><span>.

I have to keep that in check. I don't like training lightly, I like to train hard and put all my body into it. I want to lift heavy weights. I want to do what footballers do. I go to Performance Training Systems, which a couple other cast members go to. It's an amazing training place."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_435715189.jpg><p><span>LaRoyce Hawkins wants to give back to Chicago, and talked about this in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Source</span></a><span>.

"I just really believe that you just can't let [rejection] get to you. I mean, sometimes it does, and I'll have moments where I'll be deflated, and I let myself feel that and I'm OK if I'm bummed out by it, and then you just try to move onto the next. I think of auditions as an opportunity to try out that character and try to distance myself from if I'm gonna book it or not. Think of the audition as an opportunity to play as opposed to an opportunity to book a job. And if the job happens, that much better. I also would always have a backup travel plan, so I'm like, 'OK, if this ends up working out, great, then I can go do that. And if it doesn't, then maybe I can go visit my family in Canada.' That way, I always have something to look forward to."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/GettyImages-1209521588.jpg><p><span>Lisseth Chavez loves to hike and spend time outside.

"I get out of bed, lay on floor and do a circuit of five exercises: squats, lunges, push-ups, sit-ups and jumping jacks. I do it four times and I'm done. Think about it this way: It's easy to do this wherever you are and I promise you will start your day energized if you do this.
