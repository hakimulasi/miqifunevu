"It smells so good," she said after spraying the LaMu scent on her arm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And there's a big reason Brown Girl Jane's new fragrance collection, which launches Nov. 18, is so enticing: they were developed using 25 years of scent science and neuroscience techniques in partnership with renowned fragrance house Firmenich.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The collection "uncovers the link between emotions, ingredients, and colors using proprietary, claimable, and science-based technology such as brain frequencies," the brand shared in a statement. In other words, the all-natural fragrances not only smell really good, but the embedded innovative technology causes sensory reactions when you wear them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a bonus, they're launching just in time for the holidays, and make for great stocking stuffers and gifts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Scent is something that is so close to us, especially as women of color," Malaika tells InStyle on a Zoom call. "It means so much, like the smell of walking into your mother's house or the smell of your best friend, or, the smell of your latest trip...all of these sorts of things really evoke such strong memories. That was the foundation upon which we built the fragrance collection, and it's an even larger love note to women of color in general, from the cities they're named after to the sort of ease that each scent evokes," she continues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That's why we called it the Wanderlust collection," Beachamp adds. "It allows us to feel transported as we inhale, and then our moods reflect that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: InStyle On: Best Beauty Buys</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fragrance names were strategically chosen to reflect "where black women live" around the world, Beauchamp shares, adding that they were inspired by the culture in those areas, which are reflected in the scents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The process from inception to finished product took over a year, Jones says. And they wanted to make sure that their signature wellness style was infused into the collection. "We were super excited about approaching product development and thinking about all of the ways to infuse wellness into really disruptive, innovative ways," Malaika says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LaMu is infused with coastal sage, salty plumeria, and coconut water â€” designed to uplift. Bahia contains water lotus, tuberose, and vanilla to relax and ease, and Casablanca comes complete with cardamom, soft suede, and glowing amber to give off soothing vibes of love and sensuality.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brown Girl Jane's summit, which Halle Berry hosted last year, is designed to uplift, inspire, and motivate women of color as well via days of health and wellness programming, with plenty of girl boss advice in the mix as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Former Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams hosted one of the virtual panels about mental health, and a select group of guests were treated to a luxe Cantu spa day at the St. Regis Hotel in addition to the lavish brunch. It was Black girl magic personified, and there was another surprise announcement to come.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the brunch, the founders also announced that they would be launching a 501 3c non-profit organization specifically tailored to help fund and support black-owned beauty brands. This would further the over $405,000 they've already given to black-owned brands in partnership with Shea Moisture and Vaseline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When we launched Brown Girl Jane, we always knew that we wanted to lead with our mission and that has always meant including and uplifting other women of color," Nia details. "We wanted that to be equally as important as our product line."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each fragrance is priced at $62 and can be purchased on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>browngirljane.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2Bzu9anZKChoqF6q63NnmScmpRis7OtxquYp5uV</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-dogs-eat-cooked-yucca-root-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can dogs eat cooked yucca root?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-soven-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Bob Soven Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
