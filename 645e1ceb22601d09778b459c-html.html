However, recent remarks have turned her into a meme on social media.</p><p><strong>Higareda </strong>went viral after the interview she gave to <strong>Yordi Rosado</strong>, to whom she stressed that she had turned down an offer to act in a movie with <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> in the United States in order to stay in Mexico to star in the film 'No Manches Frida'.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Higareda's incredible 'adventures'</h2><p>These comments did nothing but cause people's mockery. The aforementioned Mexican production had a good response at the box office in 2016, but both <strong>Martha </strong>and her co-star, <strong>Omar Chaparro</strong>, made other movies together before the audience got fed up with them.</p><p>Then, many people on social media did not believe her claims and called it a lie, since they could not imagine how someone had rejected a role alongside the star of 'The Batman' and the 'Twilight' saga for one alongside the controversial former Telehit host.</p><p>Then fans remembered that <strong>Higareda </strong>had also shared dubious stories in the past. For instance, the actress said she met <strong>Canelo Alvarez</strong> on a plane and said she didn't know who he was, that she thought he was a 'narco'. Then they talked and she predicted he would win a fight.</p><p>Other stories include when she claimed she could speak at four years old, or how her family have seen aliens.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The NFL 'makes fun' of Martha Higareda</h2><p>Now, it was the turn of the NFL Mexico's Twitter account to create a meme about <strong>Higareda</strong>.</p><p>"I promise, <strong>Yordi</strong>," the meme reads.</p><p>"I taught <strong><a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a></strong> how to throw on a farm in Texas."</p><p>This comes as the NFL Mexico account was promoting the schedule release for the new season, in which the <strong><a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a></strong> quarterback will play on opening night against the <strong>Detroit Lions</strong>.</p><p>There won't be any NFL game in Mexico this season, however, due to renovations at the Estadio Azteca.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeblru0rdJmmqKsqWKwqbXEn6poamBngHB8lGhoa2dmaYKmfcKemWtqZmV%2BpXyYcG5xmmRqhqR6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./happy-fathers-day-what-history-how-celebrate-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paganism, roses and how the campaign to celebrate dads was won</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./musical-instrument-that-rhymes-with-lobo-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Musical instrument that rhymes with lobo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
