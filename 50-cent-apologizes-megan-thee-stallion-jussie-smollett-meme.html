However, a specific point in the trial made him change his tune.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I’m gonna apologize to Megan Thee Stallion,” 50 said. “I said some things, and it was because…&nbsp;On social media I posted things that, when she was with Gayle [King], she said: ‘Were you intimate with Tory Lanez?’ And she said: ‘What?’ and it was like, ‘No.’ And I was like, ‘Ah, she lying.’</p><p>“At that point I knew she was lying, it wouldn’t be no reason for them to be around each other,” he continued. “From that it felt like she was lying – to me.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>50 added that it was<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener> Tory Lanez’s call to Megan’s former friend Kelsey Harris from jail</a>, which was played in the trial as evidence, that gave him a different perspective.</p><p>“I should apologize to her, because when I heard the phone conversation – that made me feel like, ‘Oh shit,’” he said. “’Now I know what happened.’ I’m sure that was probably what swayed people in court, too.”</p><p>You can watch the full interview below:</p><p></p><p>The call was allegedly made from Hollywood Jail the day after the shooting. While Tory didn’t specifically mention the shooting or a gun in the call, prosecutors argued he was apologizing for shooting Megan.</p><p>The almost five-minute call begins with Tory asking Kelsey if she’s “good” and which hospital Megan was being treated at. He then offers an apology to both women, who he was allegedly sleeping with at the time.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I know she’s probably never ever gonna talk to me ever again but… bruh, I just want you to know, I was just so fucking drunk, I don’t even know what the fuck was going on, deadass. I’d never do some shit like that,” Lanez said on the call.</p><p>“Regardless, that’s not gonna make anything right and that’s not gonna make my actions right, but I’m deeply sorry for that. I never even move like that at all. For real, for real, dawg.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I know,” Harris replied with a sigh. “It was a lot, it was a lot that happened.”</p><p>Tory continued: “A whole lot, bruh. I feel crazy, but what happened happened already; I can’t take it back. I’m just telling y’all I’m sorry, bruh. I think we were just too drunk.</p><p>“When I got to the house, they gave me like five shots, like off the door, you feel me? So I was outta there. I don’t even remember what we was even arguing about.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/12/chika-blasts-50-cent-for-comparing-megan-thee-stallion-to-jussie-smollett-250x142.jpg alt="CHIKA Blasts 50 Cent For Comparing Megan Thee Stallion To Jussie Smollett" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>CHIKA Blasts 50 Cent For Comparing Megan Thee Stallion To Jussie Smollett</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 19, 2022</p></a><p>In 2020, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>50 Cent admitted he’d made jokes about the shooting prematurely</a> and apologized to Meg after she’d tearfully addressed the incident in an Instagram Live session.</p><p>“Damn I didn’t think this shit was real,” 50 wrote on IG with a clip of Meg’s Live. “It sounded so crazy @theestallion i’m glad your feeling better and i hope you can accept my apology.
