Some love her, some don’t really care of her, and some think that she’s just a little bit interesting but they’re not quite certain where she stands as a person. The general consensus is that she’s a little bit flaky and not all that bright. And just when you think that she’s going to smarten up and do something useful, she says something else that makes people remember they don’t consider her all that bright. She’s a gorgeous woman who clearly has brains, a great job and she’s working on her graduate degree, which leads us to believe that her persona is not exactly on target as far as how she presents herself to the world. So what else do we not know about the reality star? Let’s find out.</p><h2>She’s Divorced and Dating her Ex</h2><p>She was married to her ex-husband, Bobby, for 14 months before the couple made the decision to divorce. They’re now back together and working on their relationship in hopes that things will be different a second time around.</p><h2>She Wants her Ex Husband to Propose</h2><p>Even though they’re divorced, it seems that Mirza wants her ex-husband to ask her to marry him again. Apparently she thinks that things will work out a lot better this time around than they did the last time.</p><h2>She Admires Kim Kardashian’s Brains</h2><p>She recently gave an interview in which she stated that she feels Kim Kardashian is quite smart. We can’t tell if Kim K. and Asifa Mirza are both geniuses who know how to work the system and get fame or if Kim K. is really just the product of her mother’s hard work and reality pimping. Team undecided over here.</p><h2>She’s Wealthy</h2><p>Asifa Mirza has a net worth of approximately $2 million. She probably has more that we don’t know about, and she certainly will if she remarries her ex. He was the owner of several retail stores he sold for much more than her net worth recently.</p><h2>She’s Taking a Break from School</h2><p>She’s made a big deal over the fact that she’s gone back to college at UCLA to obtain her graduate degree, but she’s since decided to take a little break and focus on her career. She’s a Vice President of Marketing in LA and apparently she’s doing quite well with that.</p><p>Photo by Shahs of Sunset</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiYrKGWlnqutdGzmGasn6N6s7HSqZycrF2gtq55ypqpnZmjnbaiutJmmauZmaPAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./randy-arozarena-contract-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Behind Randy Arozarenas Renewed Contract and 2023 Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./56-pro-wrestling-cow-palace-royale-results-moores-person-report-cody-rhodes-vs-joey-ryan-cage-match-luster-legend-vs-jeff-cobb-vs-john-mundo-vs-brian-cage-apw-univ.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>5/6 All Pro Wrestling Cow Palace Royale results: Moores in-person report on Cody Rhodes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
