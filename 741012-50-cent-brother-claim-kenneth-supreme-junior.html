Furthermore, he suggested that he and Fif's son, whom he is friends with, should take a DNA test. "That’s a question that the world wants to know [the answer to]," Kenneth Jr concluded.</p><p>The theory that Supreme is Fif's father is a long-standing one. This is in spite of the fact that many people believe Supreme to be the one behind Fif's 2000 shooting. Neither Supreme nor Fif have ever acknowledged the theory, for good reason. It appears that the beef between The Supreme Team and <a href=# class=text-word rel>G-Unit</a> is alive and well. Just last month, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Fat Joe</a> warned Fif's fans about hanging out with Kenneth Jr and other members of the organization.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>50 Cent's Diddy Documentary Officially In The Works: "I'm The Best Producer For The Job"</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-50-cent-takes-aim-at-new-claims-in-power-lawsuit>50 Cent Takes Aim At New Claims In Power Lawsuit</h2></span><p>Meanwhile, Fif has been busy handling some of his outstanding legal issues. The G-Unit Mogul has requested the dismissal of assault charges claimed by Corey "Ghost" Holland. Fif has said that the former drug dealer "waited too long" to add the assault allegations to his already existing $1 billion lawsuit against the <a href=# rel>G-Unit</a> mogul. “Plaintiff’s claim that he suffered from severe emotional distress is undermined by the allegations that Plaintiff owns a weapon and he and his family repeatedly tried to confront Jackson,” Fif's legal team noted in court filings. "The allegation that Jackson ‘actually came to plaintiff home and neighborhood’ and ‘<a href=# rel>pull[ed] up</a> to plaintiff home’ does not constitute a claim for assault," Fif's motion added.</p><p>Holland is suing Fif for $1 billion. The former drug dealer claimed that Fif is using his life story as inspiration for the Power series without permission. The additional assault claims have added an additional $300 mill to the suit. Holland has alleged that Fif has tried to intimidate him into retracting his lawsuit. “The alleged conduct—Jackson ‘came to plaintiff home and neighborhood’—took place over a year before this Action was commenced. Around late July or early August 2021, Plaintiff can’t remember exactly your honor, but defendant Jackson decided to come to plaintiff neighborhood, not once, but twice. This claim is thus untimely. The assault claim should therefore be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Because the First Amended Complaint is devoid of any allegations to support such a claim against Jackson," Fif's motion states.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>The Game Once Tried To Use An NBA Star To Jump 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg Credited With Preventing Violence</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaX5xfZFmbGllk5q7tXnBq6atoJWneqS4wKKkZqOVo7umwMdmqq6oopq6pnnJrqWip6I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-chelsey-jordan-from-season-3-of-love-is-blind.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All About Chelsey Jordan From Season 3 Of Love Is Blind?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./married-at-first-sight-divorce-steve-and-noi-confirm-split.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Married at First Sight' Divorce: Steve and Noi Confirm Split</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
