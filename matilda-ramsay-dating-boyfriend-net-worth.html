Around the same time,</span><span>&nbsp;it was rumored that she has been dating Luciano D’Acampo, the son of a trained chef and TV host, Gino D’Acampo.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Rumor of Gordon's daughter's relationship with&nbsp;Luciano was the worst nightmare for&nbsp;him. </span><span>Unfortunately, his nightmare came true when Matilda went on a date with Luciano in a London restaurant, Heddon Street Kitchen.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, </span><span>Gordon with his friend, Gino, and Fred, were returning from a road trip. Gino made a video call with his son, Luciano, after being involved in a pretty grim car crash in Mexico. At the same time, Matilda, who was on a date with Luciano, was seen by her father.</span></p><p><span>Gordon was shocked after seeing his daughter and asked what she has been doing with Luciano. She replied with a laugh that they were on a dinner date.

On the other hand, she&nbsp;<span>shared a photo from her 18th birthday cuddling with her boyfriend Seth in South Africa.</span></span></p><p><span>This made her fan confused about her relationship, whether she has been dating Seth or Luciano.</span></p><p><span>When grilled about who she was dating, Matilda confirmed that Seth was her only boyfriend.</span></p><h2><span><strong>What Is The Net Worth of Matilda Ramsay?</strong></span></h2><p><span>Matilda Ramsay has followed in her father's footsteps since her early age.
