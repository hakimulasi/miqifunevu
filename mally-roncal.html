Mally Roncal is popular as the founder and president of Mally Beauty.</h3><h2>What is the Estimated Net Worth of Mally Roncal?</h2><p>Mally has amassed a sizable fortune throughout the course of her career. Her net worth is presently believed to be<strong> $2</strong> <strong>million US dollars</strong>, according to online sources. As a makeup artist, she was able to earn such a large sum of money.</p><h2>Early Years</h2><p>Melissa “Mally” Hernandez Roncal was born on January 8, 1972, in Middletown, New York, United States. As of 2021, she is 49 years old and of American nationality. She also comes from a Christian household and was born under the sign of Capricorn.</p><p>In terms of her relatives, she was born into a Filipino-American family. She hasn’t revealed the identities of her parents or siblings, however. Her mother was an OB/GYN and her father was a psychiatrist.</p><p>Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1970s. Her mother died when she was 17 years old as a result of this. Her mother serves as a source of inspiration for her. Because she is Filipino, she grew up watching a lot of QVC. She claims that watching QVC helped her improve her English language skills.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>When it comes to her educational background, she first studied dermatology before switching to a creative arts degree. She earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Marist College in 1993.</p><h2>Career and Professional Life</h2><p>Mally began her career as a makeup artist at the Shiseido counter at Barneys New York and with private clientele. She rose to recognition as a professional makeup artist by working with celebrities such as Beyoncé, Celine Dion, and Angelina Jolie. Roncal later spent many years as a Sephora spokesman, which required her to travel frequently.</p><p>Mally founded Mally Beauty in 2004-05 after becoming dissatisfied with the globe-trotting lifestyle. Her brand focuses on “enhancing your attractiveness for real life,” rather than high-maintenance makeup. Mally Beauty offers over 1000 products, with a focus on easy-to-use, everyday things with the purpose of solving market gaps.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mallys-book-Lips-Lashes-and-Lipstick-1.jpg alt width=650 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Caption: Mally’s book “Lips, Lashes, and Lipstick” (source: Instagram)</strong></p><p>On her debut show with QVC, Mally was given a full one-hour presentation to market her items, which was unique.

Roncal has always been intrigued to the spiritual element of healing, which she combines into her stunning art.</p><p>In addition to her beauty job and firm, Mally writes editorials for the New York Times, Huffington Post, and Village. She also appears frequently on shows such as The View, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Rachael Ray, and Today.
