time<br>On the battlefield he gained respect for fame<br>With many metals of bravery and stripes to his name<br>He grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face<br>And always urged his men on<br>But on the eve of great battle with the infantry and dream<br>The old general tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaning<br>He awoke from that night to tell what he had seen<br>And walked slowly out of his tent<br>All the men held tall with their chests in the air<br>With the courage in their blood and a fire in their stare<br>And it was a gray morning and they all wondered how they would fair<br>Till the old general told them to go home</p><p>Chorus:<br>He said,<br>I have seen the others and I have discovered that this fight is not worth fighting<br>And I’ve have seen their mothers and I will no other to follow me where I’m going<br>So, take your shower, shine your shoes<br>You got no time to lose<br>You are young men you must be living<br>Take your shower, shine your shoes<br>Well, you got no time to lose<br>You are young men you must be living<br>Go now you are forgiven</p><p>But the men stood fast with their guns on their shoulders<br>Not knowing what to do with the contradicting orders<br>The general said he would do his own duty<br>But he would extend it no further<br>The men could go as they pleased<br>But not a man moved their eyes gazed straight ahead<br>Till one by one they stepped back and not a word was said<br>And the old general was left with his own words echoing in his head<br>He then prepared to fight</p><p>Chorus<br>He said,<br>I have seen the others and I have discovered that this fight is not worth fighting<br>And I’ve have seen their mothers and I will no other to follow me where I’m going<br>So, take your shower, shine your shoes<br>You got no time to lose<br>You are young men you must be living<br>Take your shower, shine your shoes<br>Well, you got no time to lose<br>You are young men you must be living<br>Go now you are forgiven</p><p>Go now you are forgiven<br>Go now you are forgiven<br>Go now you are forgiven<br>Go now you are forgiven</p><p class=postsid
