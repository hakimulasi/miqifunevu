In Woodland, Utah, he was involved in a snowmobile accident, which resulted in his death.&nbsp;Harley Morenstein, an actor and online celebrity, paid homage to him on Facebook, writing that he met Block after joining Gymkhana. He claimed that Block was quite helpful and provided them with the greatest counsel. The message went on to say,</p><p>“He was a fantastic resource, mentor, and all-around amazing guy. I’m really saddened to learn of his death, and we’re sending healing hugs and soothing prayers to his family and friends.”</p><h2>Ken Block’s net worth</h2><p>Although Ken Block was best known as an accomplished rally driver for the Hoonigan Racing Division, he was also a co-founder of DC Shoes with Damon Way, Danny Way, Clayton Blehm, Colin McKay, and Rob Dyrdek.&nbsp;Quicksilver acquired the firm for $87 million and then renamed it. DC Shoes was founded in 2010 to help Block compete in the World Championships. According to Hot Cars, Block’s successful career in motor racing, as well as his work with fashion brands and social media, has helped him amass a substantial fortune. DC Shoes started with a profit of roughly $1.5 million and quickly grew to a profit of $100 million each year.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ken-Block-3.jpg alt="Ken Block" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ken also founded Hoonigan Industries, which includes a massive array of sports equipment and accessories.
