With the Cincinnati Bengals taking on the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Buffalo Bills</a>, they set the stage for a grand fight between two beasts in the AFC. However, in the first quarter of the game, Bills’ safety, Damar Hamlin, collapsed after a taking a hit by Bengals’ wide receiver Tee Higgins. The game had to be stopped and the medical personnel monitored the safety after he received CPR on the field.</p><p>Following the hit, Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest. Fortunately, his heartbeat was restored on the field. They then rushed Hamlin to a hospital, where 24-year-old still remains under critical condition. After holding discussions with both the head coaches, Zac Taylor and Sean McDermott, the refs sent the teams back to the locker room. Further monitoring the developments of the night, the league postponed the game. Both the sides were visibly shaken up by what had happened in front of their eyes. Especially the Bills who were concerned for their teammate.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just stood with Tee Higgins’ mom who is now walking out with Tee who has his arm wrapped around her.

Cincinnati Bengals beat reporter Kelsey Conway, shared a post from ground which showed the wideout being consoled by his mother.</p><p>It is hard to imagine the emotional turmoil surrounding Higgins. But the fans have come out to comfort the player as well.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We love you so much <a href=#>@teehiggins5</a> keep your head up, this was in no way, shape, or form your fault whatsoever. 100% a freak accident.

It is also heartwarming to see the fans, players and experts who have all showed great support and understanding for the sides involved in this.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Updates on Damar Hamlin</h2><p>Following the postponement of the game, the Buffalo Bills released a statement to give clarity on the situation. The tweet <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>read</a>, “Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest following a hit in our game versus the Bengals. His heartbeat was restored on the field and he was transferred to the UC Medical Center for further testing and treatment. He is currently sedated and listed in critical condition.”</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-nfl-news-im-praying-like-never-before-dustin-poirier-paige-van-zant-jon-jones-brother-react-to-damar-hamlins-absolutely-terrifying-injury?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2023-01-03-at-11.33.55-AM-560x285.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">‘I’m Praying Like Never Before’: Dustin Poirier, Paige Van Zant, Jon Jones’ Brother React to Damar Hamlin’s Absolutely ‘Terrifying’ Injury</p></a><p>The league also cleared that they are constantly in contact with the NFL Players Association who are in agreement to postpone the game. About 100 Bills fans and a few Bengals fans gathered on a corner one block from the emergency room entrance, with some of them holding candles.</p><p>The rivalry melted away during this tough time. Bengals’ QB <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Joe Burrow</a> reached out to the opposition QB <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Josh Allen</a> to embrace the horror-stricken figure.
