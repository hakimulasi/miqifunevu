Carrie gave birth to her second son, Jacob Bryan Fisher four months ago. She gave birth to her first son, Isaiah Michael Fisher in 2015.&nbsp; The sunny photo was captured outside and showed Carrie in her bikini soaking up some rays. Sharing the photos with her 8.5 million Instagram followers, it quickly went viral and drew praise from many who complimented her figure.</p><p>The photo has over 150,000 likes and more than 1,000 comments.</p><p>It‚Äôs unclear where Carrie took the selfies from, but there are two pictures that she shared. In the first, Carrie can be seen with her hair pulled back while holding a hat. Her stomach is flat and toned while the Grammy and Country Music Award winner wore a blue and white bikini. Carrie appeared to have zero body fat and many were impressed by her toned and athletic physique.</p><p>You may see the photos Carrie Underwood shared on her Instagram account below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/ByGrHkcl9mA/</p><p>If you felt that Carrie looked athletic, that was her purpose and intent.</p><p>The bikini Carrie wore was actually from her own swimwear line: CALIA Swimwear.</p><p>Carrie captioned her bikini shots with the following:</p><p>#TBT&nbsp;to the first Cali run on&nbsp;#CryPrettyTour360&nbsp;‚Äì getting ready for summer! ‚òÄÔ∏èüï∂&nbsp;@CALIAbyCarrie&nbsp;#CALIASwimwear#StayThePath&nbsp;#Southbound</p><p>The photos were a great way to promote the clothing line and her fans sounded off that they were interested in purchasing the swimwear for themselves.</p><p>Carrie Underwood shared the same pics on her official CALIA by Carrie Instagram account that features more of the product line including workout wear, leggings, hoodies, and more two-piece bathing suits.</p><p>Though Carrie used the #TBT hashtag, don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking she shared a pre-pregnancy photo.</p><p>Carrie‚Äôs pictures are from her Cry Pretty Tour 360 (as she also hashtagged) which began on May 1, 2019. Carrie had already given birth to baby Jacob when she took the bikini selfies.</p><p>Carrie Underwood‚Äôs fans are devoted to the singer and have supported her through her ups and downs.
