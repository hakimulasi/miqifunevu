New mother <strong><a href=#>Eva Mendes</a></strong> made a rare post-baby appearance on Wednesday, Dec. 3, and looked gorgeous and glowing after giving birth to her first child, daughter <strong>Esmeralda</strong>, two months ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a></strong>‘s stunning love, 40, stopped by The Ellen DeGeneres Show and turned heads in a chic red dress from her own line for New York & Company. Paired with a sparkling jewelry from her New York & Company accessories collection and metallic pumps, the sleeveless number showed off Mendes’ trim post-baby body.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lost River actress entered <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong>‘ set smiling, looking happy and radiant as she caught up with the funnywoman about her little girl and parenthood with her man Gosling.&nbsp;</p><p>DeGeneres put Mendes on the spot, asking why she never confirmed her pregnancy, even when asked point-blank about the news on The Ellen Show. She went so far as to call the new mother a “liar” for denying the pregnancy rumors when asked by DeGeneres.</p><p>“Not really because I was so early on!” Mendes defended herself. “All moms will understand, you’re not supposed to tell anybody during your first… well certainly not the world… in your first trimester. My mother didn’t even know yet. So that would have been an awkward phone call. ‘Hey mom did you catch Ellen today?’ Um, oops!”</p><p>The Miami-born beauty went on to explain why she and Gosling, 34, decided to keep the news so shrouded in secrecy.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=542 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="eva mendes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“I think just early on, we decided it’s going to be so hard for her to have privacy,” Mendes said. “We thought this is the first opportunity we can give her to protect her and so that I had a nice calm pregnancy, which I did.”</p><p>While Mendes’ pregnancy was calm, her first two months of motherhood have been less relaxing. Asked whether baby Esmeralda, who was born on Sept. 12, is sleeping through the night, the Fast and Furious alum exclaimed, “No! No, God no. She’s 2 months! You know, we’re getting the hang of it, the sleeping thing, but yeah I’m exhausted and it’s the best.”</p><p>“Really, I’m so incredibly tired,” she added. “I thought I was tired before at times, but no. Nothing like this, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p>“The whole bounce back thing… I’m like… ‘Oh gosh. Ease up. It’s okay. We don’t have to…’ you know?” she explained. “I mean, eventually maybe, but certainly not in a couple weeks.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite her relaxed demeanor, Mendes already looks slim and gorgeous, which she attributes to a natural action, rather than hitting the gym for hours on end. &nbsp;</p><p>“I’m, you know, breastfeeding,” she spilled. “I’ve always heard it. It really does help to shrink your uterus back to normal size. It does! I know it’s a really weird thing to say, but it does. It’s the best. So it’s breastfeeding is really helping and then obviously you want to be healthy for the baby because she’s eating kind of what I’m eating, so you want to make good choices.”</p><p>Gosling, who started dating Mendes in 2011 and collaborated with her on 2013’s The Place Beyond the Pines, has yet to comment on his new role as a father and his daughter Esmeralda.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJyvmV2isq%2BwxKxknaGjnbK0ec6nZJ6wmJbCtMDIp55mpZ%2Bptaa%2Bx6imnWWbmrKxtc2gZKmqlZy7orrCsmSsnZOnsrV5kWlobWthZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./965147-exclusive-the-briscoe-brothers-sound-off-on-dark-path-they-are-on-w-young-bucks-ahead-of-roh-best-in-the-world.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Exclusive: The Briscoe Brothers Sound Off On Dark Path They Are On w/ Young Bucks Ahead Of</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./erinn-hayess-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Erinn Hayess net worth, biography, fact, career, awards and life story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
