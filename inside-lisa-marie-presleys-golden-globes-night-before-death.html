According to an onlooker, Lisa Marie had a sweet moment with Butler, 31, as he spoke to press <a href=#>before the awards show began</a> and snapped a selfie with another attendee.</p><p>Lisa Marie was joined by her mother, <a href=#><strong>Priscilla Presley</strong></a>, at the star-studded event. The twosome got emotional as the Carrie Diaries alum <a href=#>accepted the trophy</a> for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama for his role in <a href=#><strong>Baz Luhrmann</strong>‘s Elvis</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lisa-Marie-Presley-Was-In-Good-Spirits-at-2023-Golden-Globes-With-Austin-Butler-2-Days-Before-Her-Death.jpg><p>“Thank you for opening your hearts, your memories [and] your home to me,” Butler gushed on stage after winning his first-ever Golden Globe. “Lisa Marie, Priscilla, I love you forever.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed on Thursday, January 12, that <a href=#>Lisa Marie was rushed to the hospital</a> after suffering cardiac arrest. She reportedly <a href=#>received CPR at her home</a> in Calabasas, California, and her pulse recovered before her hospitalization. Hours later, Priscilla, 77, <a href=#>announced her daughter’s death</a>.</p><p>“It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us,” she said in a statement to People on Thursday. “She was the most passionate strong and loving woman I have ever known. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss. Thank you for the love and prayers. At this time there will be no further comment.”</p><p>Ahead of the mother-daughter duo’s <a href=#>Golden Globes appearance</a>, the pair were outspoken about their support for Butler and his performance as the late musician. (Elvis died at age 42 in August 1977, four years after <a href=#>his divorce from Priscilla</a> was finalized.)</p><p>“I’ve seen Baz Luhrmann’s movie Elvis twice now,” Lisa Marie tweeted in May 2022, urging her fans to see the critically acclaimed film. “Let me tell you that it is nothing short of spectacular. Absolutely exquisite. Austin Butler channeled and embodied my father’s heart & soul beautifully.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lisa-Marie-Presley-Was-In-Good-Spirits-at-2023-Golden-Globes-With-Austin-Butler-2-Days-Before-Her-Death-promo.jpg><p>That same month, <a href=#>Priscilla shared her honest thoughts</a> about the biopic after attending a private screening. “This story is about Elvis and [manager] Colonel Parker’s relationship. It is a true story told brilliantly and creatively that only Baz, in his unique artistic way, could have delivered,” the Elvis Presley Enterprises cofounder wrote via Facebook. “Austin Butler, who played Elvis is outstanding.”</p><p>The New York native went on to praise <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a>, who portrayed Elvis’ longtime manager, Tom Parker. She watched the movie with her ex-husband’s pal <strong>Jerry Schilling</strong>, who marveled at Butler’s transformation.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Halfway through the film Jerry and I looked at each other and said WOW!!!” Priscilla continued. “Bravo to him … he knew he had big shoes to fill. He was extremely nervous playing this part. I can only imagine.”</p><p>Along with Priscilla, Lisa Marie is survived by her three daughters: <a href=#><strong>Riley Keough</strong></a>, whom she shared with first husband <a href=#><strong>Danny Keough</strong></a>, and <a href=#>twins Harper and Finley</a>, whom she welcomed with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Michael Lockwood</strong></a> in October 2008. She was predeceased by son <a href=#>Benjamin Keough</a>, who died by suicide at age 27 in July 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ5y6KqmmWdlr%2BqsYypqZ6rnJrGtHnGqKOdnZ5itK27wZ6qZqaZnLW1ecGenaiqlWKxpq3ToWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-mccarthy-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John McCarthy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-are-the-best-kidnapping-movies-on-netflix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here are the best kidnapping movies on Netflix</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
