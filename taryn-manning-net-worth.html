The band signed a deal with DreamWorks Records in 2002 and released the album "Boomkatalog.One" in 2003. Boomkat's first single, "The Wreckoning," topped the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart.

In October 2012, Manning was arrested after she assaulted Holly Hartman, her personal assistant/makeup artist. Holly, who lived with Taryn at the time, declined to press charges, and the following month, a judge granted an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal on the terms that Manning completed one day of community service and exhibited good behavior for six months. Taryn was accused of attacking Hartman again in 2016, and though Holly filed for a restraining order, she was denied&nbsp;because of jurisdictional issues.</p><p>In November 2014, Manning was arrested for making criminal threats and violating a restraining order that was taken out by her ex-girlfriend, Jeanine Heller. Taryn accused Heller of harassing her in 2015, which resulted in Jeanine being sentenced to four months in jail. In 2016, it was discovered that Manning had lied about the contact violations, and Heller stated, "We have been able to confirm without a doubt that Taryn fabricated the documents she provided the ADA. Confirmation has come directly from each source â€” AT&T has confirmed her text allegations throughout the case have been false. In August 2014 Taryn claimed I left her a voicemail that led to an arrest for a violation. We have now been able to show that her evidence was simply a past voicemail I had left her prior to any legal drama in June 2014 that she simply recorded it again and claimed it to be from Aug 2014. Another source, TrueCaller, has confirmed the screenshots she submitted were 'not authentic' and an act of 'forgery.'"</p><p>In 2019, several Instagram posts including disparaging remarks about "Orange is the New Black" were posted on Manning's account, and she claimed that her account was "epically hacked." Taryn has struggled with alcohol abuse, and in 2016, the producers of "Orange is the New Black" threatened to fire her from the show unless she went to rehab. Taryn reportedly left rehab after just one day.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>The "Orange Is the New Black" cast was nominated for four Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, winning in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and Manning and her "Hustle & Flow" co-stars earned an Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture nomination in 2006. Taryn was named Film Fashion Visionary at the 2009 Bel Air Film Festival, and in 2014, she was ranked #8 for IMDb's Top 10 Breakout Stars Award. Manning received a Gold Derby Award nomination for Comedy Guest Actress for "Orange Is the New Black" in 2014 and a Washington DC Area Film Critics Association Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance for "Hustle & Flow" in 2005, and the "Hustle & Flow" cast earned a Black Reel Award nomination for Best Ensemble in 2006.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMGivtinZKaZnqO2r7OMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nikki-finke-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Veteran Hollywood Journalist Nikki Finke Has Died, at 68, Her Cause Of Death Explored</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-jessica-parker-catfight-kim-cattrall.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Jessica Parker denies there was ever a 'catfight' with Kim Cattrall</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
