According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Rivers’ net worth is as high as $8 million, an amount earned through his successful career, active since 2012.</p><h3>Austin Rivers Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>The son of Doc Rivers and his wife Kristen, Austin has three siblings, who are also involved in basketball, though playing without any major success. He attended Winter Park High School with which he won two Florida 6A state championship titles in 2010 and 2011, and which earned him the 2011 Naismith Prep Player of the Year, and several other honors, such as McDonald’s All-American, and First-team Parade All-American.</p><p>After successful high school years, Austin committed to Duke University, and to play for the Blue Devils, but remained in college for just one year, playing in 34 games, 33 of which were starts, and in 33 minutes on the court, Austin averaged 15.5 points per game, 2.1 assists and 3.4 rebounds per game. He led his team to the Round of 64 in the NCAA tournament, but there lost by Lehigh University. In the particular game, Austin wasn’t quite up to his standard, shooting only 35 % from the field.</p><p>After the season ended, Austin declared for the 2012 NBA Draft and was chosen by the New Orleans Hornets as the 10th overall pick. He became a professional on the 24th July 2012, signing a rookie scale contract, and choosing the No. 25 for his jersey, which is the same number that his father wore while in the NBA.</p><p>He was given playing time right away, and in the first game of the season, Austin had seven points, shooting 1-9 from the field, but he bounced back in December, and scored his then career-high 27 points, but that wasn’t enough since his team lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves. His rookie season was nowhere near expectation, as he had only 6.2 points per game, with 2.1 assists and 1.8 rebounds, which only earned him ACC Rookie of the Year and First-team All-ACC honors. He remained in New Orleans until the mid- 2014-2015 season, when he was traded to the Boston Celtics, but before even making his debut for the Celtics, Austin was sent to the Los Angeles Clippers. He debuted for the Clippers on the 16th January 2015, becoming the first son to play for his father in an NBA game.</p><p>Unfortunately, his numbers didn’t improve, and he finished the season with only 7.1 points per game. The following year Austin received more playing time, and in 67 games for the Clippers, Rivers averaged 8.9 points per game, helping the team reach the playoffs.</p><p>Austin continued to play better under the guidance of his father, playing his best basketball in the 2016-2017 season with 12.0 points per game, 2.8 assists and 2.2 rebounds. Throughout the season, he had several career-high points games, including 28 points scored against the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>Encouraged by his improvement, Austin carried the momentum into the 2017-2018 season, posting another career-high, with 30 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but it wasn’t enough since his team lost 112-106. His next record was 36 points against the Houston Rockets, on the 22nd December, while in the next match, he scored 38 points, playing the following night against the Memphis Grizzlies, so his game and potential net worth is improving.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Austin has been in a relationship with his high school sweetheart Brittany Hotard for several years now, and most recently, the couple announced their engagement.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.270803949224><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Austin Rivers</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>11&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 1, 1992</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santa Monica, California USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.93 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>91 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Duke University, Winter Park High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Kristen Rivers</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Austin Rivers, Jeremiah Rivers, Callie Rivers, Spencer Rivers</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Doc Rivers, Kristen Rivers</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Jeremiah Rivers, Callie Rivers, Spencer Rivers</td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/austinrivers25</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36734693877551><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/austinjrivers/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7372780/</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Awards</td><td>Naismith Boy's High School Player of the Year, Parade All-America Boys Basketball Team, Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Rookie of the Year</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpqsrKyZo3qztdWeqaxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chase-chrisley-todd-chrisley-son-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-dating-net-worth-career-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chase Chrisley (Todd Chrisley Son) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Dating, Net Worth, Career, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./april-2023-general-conference-download-chart-general-authorities-and-general-officers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>April 2023 Church leadership chart</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
