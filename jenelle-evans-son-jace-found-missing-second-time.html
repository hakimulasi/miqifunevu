The teen was apparently found at a gas station after leaving their home in North Carolina on Monday. Jenelle‚Äôs manager,&nbsp;<strong>August Keen</strong>, told the outlet that Jace was gone for several hours without contact, causing his mom to grow concerned and get the cops involved in finding him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The gas station that Jace was located at was 10 minutes from his family home, and it‚Äôs unclear if he was alone or with friends. The situation happened just weeks after he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was reported missing</a> after he left school earlier this month. Jenelle, who is also the mother of son<strong> Kaiser</strong>, 9, and daughter <strong>Ensley</strong>, 6, spoke out about the incident and explained why she was concerned, in a statement shortly after the report made headlines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jenelle-evans-and-jace-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>‚ÄúAs a boy mom, kids can act up and rebel as I‚Äôm sure the majority of us all once did as kids too.

He was later found safe, and his reason for running away was reportedly because his phone was taken away by Jenelle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Now that he‚Äôs luckily been found safely for a second time, August further told TMZ that Jace, who can be seen with Jenelle in photos below, has been home with Jenelle and her husband,<strong> David Eason</strong>, and they are all getting along. August also said that the teen wants to have more freedom as he gets older and has just been acting like a typical teenager.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jenelle welcomed Jace with her ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andrew Lewis</strong></a>, during her teen years. Although her mom, <strong>Barbara</strong>, was given custody of him back in 2009, Jenelle revealed she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had taken over custody</a> earlier this year. ‚Äú#MyHappyEnding, ITS OFFICIAL! Thanks everyone for the support!‚Äù she wrote alongside the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>heartwarming clip</a> that showed her signing paperwork and talking about getting Jace back into her home. ‚ÄúWords can‚Äôt describe how happy i truly am.
