We can’t wear what we want. We can’t hang around who we want,” Ginn said, revealing his ink would stay.</p><p>Ginn, Pettigrove, and Copeman received a conviction and an acquittal each for displaying banned gang tattoos at a pool party in breach of the tough new legislation.</p><p>Hells Angel Tyson Robinson was cleared of all charges.</p><p>A tip-off in January 2022 resulted in charges of publicly displaying club insignia or logos.</p><p>The Rebels members’ were said to be brandishing club ink, and all were alleged to be showing “1%er” ink.</p><p>Defence lawyers argued as the pool at the Rendezvous Hotel is not public, no laws were broken.</p><p>Though that was to little avail, with the magistrate rejecting the argument.</p><p>Of the seven charges in total, just three were convicted.</p><p>Despite the mixed result, WA Police Commissioner Col Blanch claimed the outcome was a “win for police”.</p><p>“There were three convictions, and this is the first time it’s been done,” he said.</p><p>Other bikies have <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=cdf289d33a48af4b5cf5f56e3113c6a3 data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev>been hit with summons under the new laws</a> but have opted to cop the fine instead. Tuesday marked the legislation’s first courtroom test.</p><p>Under the new Western Australian laws targeting outlaw motorcycle gangs, an offender can be jailed for up to a year and fined $12,000 for consorting or displaying the insignia of an identified organisation in a public place.</p><p>Gang tattoos and patches fall within the laws, with some members already seen publicly growing hair over or taping up tattoos.</p><p>The new laws also saw the introduction of what the WA Government itself labelled the “toughest anti-consorting regime in the country”.</p><p>Breaches carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail.</p><p>In late 2022, the heavy-handed laws were enough to unite warring gangs in solidarity against the rules. Mongols member Troy Mercanti, the first person in the state charged under the laws, kicked off a legal challenge to the High Court of Australia, represented by one of the state’s top barristers.</p><p><i><a class=body-link href=# title=www.watoday.com.au>WA Today</a></i> reported that the challenge would be bankrolled by WA gangs, with members asked to donate. It also reported that two summits with representatives from all clubs had already been held on the issue.</p><p>WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state was taking a zero-tolerance approach with introducing the new laws.</p><p>“This government is serious about stopping organised crime and protecting the community from the intimidation and violence carried out by bikie gangs,” he said.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>When quizzed on the<a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=cdf289d33a48af4b5cf5f56e3113c6a3 data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev> technicalities of the insignia laws in 2021</a>, commissioner Blanch suggested “Band-Aids” or “makeup” to cover tattoos.</p><p>“‘I would start with things like Band-Aids or makeup certainly or have it removed, or alternatively, people can choose the option not to live in Western Australia if this law passes,’ he told 6PR’s Mornings Program.</p><p>“Young men are attracted to biker clubs because of the display of being an outlaw motorcycle gang to have the insignia on display as power, the display of numbers. It’s about breaking down that sort of culture and making sure that display of violence in the community is not tolerated and is not acceptable, and I think this thing sends a strong message to outlaw motorcycle gangs.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Perth data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Perth</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwr9GipJ5nnqR6rbvNoJyrZZyew6Z5yKdkmmWWp7KmecKorKesoq56o7XKopxmnaKqvbW%2FjJqdrZ2iYrSiusZmq5qspKS8bq%2FOp62im6SevK97zZ6urGWjqbyzxY5xapyeYW6xeYPCmmdub2iWhaR9lZ%2BdbW5gZ4Knf8OfZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./granger-howell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How did Granger Howell die?
