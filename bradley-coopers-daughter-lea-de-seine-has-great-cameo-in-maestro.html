Yeah, she was great,” he gushed. “She was really awesome.”</p><p>When asked whether he would consider bringing the 6-year-old along to the 96th annual Academy Awards in March, Cooper weighed the option. “I mean, let’s see what happens,” he said.</p><p>Cooper has been known to bring his mother, <strong>Gloria Campano</strong>, as his plus-one to awards shows. Earlier this month, she glistened on <a href=#>the Golden Globes red carpet</a> with her son, who was nominated for Best Director and Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. (Cooper lost to Oppenheimer‘s <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong> and <strong>Cillian Murphy</strong>, respectively.)</p><p>Cooper plays composer <strong>Leonard Bernstein</strong> in the biographical drama alongside <strong>Carey Mulligan</strong>, <strong>Matt Bomer</strong>, <strong>Michael Urie</strong> and more. After losing its four Golden Globes nominations — Mulligan was nominated for her performance and the film was up for Best Motion Picture – Drama, along with Cooper’s individual nods — Maestro was recognized when the <a href=#>2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations</a> were announced on Wednesday, January 10. Cooper and Mulligan are up for trophies in the lead actor and actress categories.</p><p>The film has received Oscar buzz since its September 2023 release. Cooper revealed at a November 2023 screening that he spent six years learning how to conduct for one of the movie’s most crucial moments.</p><p>“That scene I was so worried about because we did it live,” he said, referring to his recreation of Bernstein conducting the London Symphony Orchestra at the Ely Cathedral in 1976. “That was the London Symphony Orchestra. I was recorded live. I had to conduct them. And I spent six years learning how to conduct six minutes and 21 seconds of music.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bradley-Cooper-Praises-Daughter-Lea-de-Seine-Really-Awesome-Cameo-in-Maestro-2.jpg><p>While Maestro was one of Cooper’s biggest passion projects, his dedication to his family didn’t waver. He shares his daughter with ex Irina Shayk, whom he dated from 2015 to 2019.</p><p>Cooper proved being a dad comes first when he <a href=#>paused a December 2023 press conference</a> after receiving a call from Lea’s school nurse. “Can I just leave the room for a second to call them back and you can keep going?” he asked after checking his phone, per the Daily Mail. “Is that all right?”</p><p>When he returned, Cooper explained that he had to go to his daughter’s school. “I have to apply something that they won’t allow … I have to do it, so it’s, like, a 10-minute walk,” he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shayk, 38, and Cooper have been candid through the years about maintaining a <a href=#>healthy family dynamic</a> post-split. In March 2021, Shayk explained why she doesn’t believe in the idea of “coparenting.”</p><p>“When I’m with my daughter, I’m 100 percent a mother, and when she’s with her dad, he’s 100 percent her dad,” she said. “Coparenting is parenting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabqpGZuabFjJymqKiVp8BusMCunqGslad6rbHAZpueZaOatq%2BxjKGYrGWXp7KiwIycmKadn2K2r3nMmpysrKKkfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bugsy-siegel-and-esta-krakower.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bugsy Siegel and Esta Krakower Photos, News and Videos, Trivia and Quotes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blac-chyna-dances-in-lingerie-in-bellys-nsfw-music-video-pop-w497046.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Blac Chyna Dances in Lingerie in Belly's NSFW Music Video P.O.P</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
