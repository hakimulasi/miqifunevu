Dolph gained prominence in the mid-2010s with a series of successful mixtapes and albums that solidified his position in the Southern hip-hop scene. He was the founder of the record label Paper Route Empire and often worked with rapper <a href=#>Gucci Mane</a>. Despite facing numerous challenges and legal troubles throughout his career, Young Dolph remained dedicated to his craft and left a lasting impact on the rap community. Tragically, Dolph was shot and killed on November 17, 2021, in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, at the age of 36.</p><h2 id=early-life-influences><strong>Early Life and Influences</strong></h2><p>Raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Young Dolph grew up in a challenging environment marked by poverty, crime, and a lack of opportunities. He found solace in music, particularly rap, which allowed him to express his experiences and emotions. Dolph was heavily influenced by Southern rap legends such as <a href=# title="Three 6 Mafia Net Worth">Three 6 Mafia</a>, 8Ball & MJG, and Playa Fly, as well as national acts like <a href=# title="Jay-Z Net Worth">Jay-Z</a> and <a href=# title="Tupac Net Worth">Tupac</a> Shakur.</p><h2 id=rise-fame><strong>Rise to Fame</strong></h2><p>Young Dolph began his career by releasing mixtapes independently, starting with "Paper Route Campaign" in 2008. He continued to build his fan base with a series of mixtapes, including "Welcome 2 Dolph World" (2010), "High Class Street Music" series (2011-2014), and "South Memphis Kingpin" (2013). It was his mixtape "High Class Street Music 5: The Plug Best Friend" (2015) that garnered widespread attention and helped solidify his position in the Southern rap scene.</p><h2 id=commercial-success><strong>Commercial Success</strong></h2><p>Dolph's first commercial success came with the release of his debut studio album "King of Memphis" in 2016. The album, which peaked at number 49 on the Billboard 200, featured tracks like "Get Paid" and "It's Goin Down." He followed up with "Bulletproof" in 2017, an album inspired by a shooting incident he survived in Charlotte, North Carolina. The same year, Dolph released "Thinking Out Loud," which included collaborations with artists like Gucci Mane, Ty Dolla $ign, and DRAM. "Role Model" followed in 2018 with "Dum and Dummer" releasing in 2019, "Rich Slave" in 2020, and "Dum and Dummer 2" in 2021. In December 2022, a posthumous album titled "Paper Route Frank" was released.</p><h2 id=business-ventures><strong>Business Ventures</strong></h2><p>Throughout his career, Young Dolph remained fiercely independent, opting to release his music through his own record label, Paper Route Empire (PRE).

He spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from his wounds. Some speculated that the attack was connected to a rivalry with rapper <a href=#>Yo Gotti</a>. Yo Gotti was named as a person of interest but was soon cleared.</p><p>Young Dolph chose the name Bulletproof for his second album based on the incident.</p><p>Tragically, Young Dolph was murdered on November 17, 2021, in a shooting incident in Memphis, Tennessee. He was gunned down by two men in a white two-door Mercedes outside of a bakery. The autopsy revealed he had been shot 22 times, and he was laid to rest in a service on November 30th. In early 2022, the two suspects were identified as 23-year-old Justin Johnson and 32-year-old Cornelius Smith. In February, the two pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder. In November 2022, a third suspect was indicted for the murder of Young Dolph and the conspiracy to murder 43-year-old Hernandez Govan, whom is alleged to have ordered the murder of Dolph. The murder trial is set to take place in March 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX668trrGZpuopKCdeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./letterkenny-season-10-hulu-comedy-tv-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Letterkenny': 5 things to know about the comedy show on Hulu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bonnie-somerville-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Bonnie Somerville Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Her Wealth and Financial</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
