Our top picks — Maybelline’s Lash Sensational Lengthening Mascara and L’Oréal’s Telescopic Lift Mascara — both create incredible length and volume under $15. Since a tube of mascara can last up to three months, you will effectively pay less than $5 per month for beautiful lashes.</p><p>Of course, not every drugstore mascara will tick all your boxes. Some of our top rated formulas are not cruelty free, and many have a moderate risk of irritation and toxicity. In addition, products with clean ingredients may not perform as well as products that pose long-term risks to your health. This isn’t to say that you can’t find a product that will meet most of your requirements. Still, it’s important to recognize that no formula is perfect.</p><p>To prevent you from feeling flustered or unable to make a decision (there are so many things to think about!), think about just these five factors listed below.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Drugstore Mascaras</h2><p><i>Before buying a drugstore mascara, consider the following factors.</i></p><h3>Type</h3><p>There are three main formulations to think about: waterproof, water resistant, and washable. Waterproof formulas have the longest staying power but often contain harsh ingredients. Water resistant formulas have a medium staying power and less-irritating ingredients. Finally, washable mascara tends to have the lowest staying power but wash off easily, which minimizes irritation.</p><p>Each type of mascara listed above can be further categorized as lengthening or volumizing. A lengthening mascara creates well-defined, clump-free, long lashes. In contrast, volumizing mascara creates thicker, fanned-out lashes. Some formulas do a little of both.</p><h3>Removal</h3><p>How important is it to you that your mascara comes off at night? Some people would prefer a formula that has the longest staying power possible, even if it means their cleansing process takes a long time. Others would much rather deal with a little smudging and have an easy removal experience. Whatever you decide, make sure you are completely cleaning your lashes at the end of the day. This will reduce the chance of breakage and thinning.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>If you have sensitive eyes and skin, the ingredient list will make or break a product. Most drugstore mascaras have at least some risk of irritation and toxicity, due to preservatives, fragrance, polymers (which enhance staying power), and colorants. If you are able to pinpoint a few ingredients that cause you problems, it may be easier to pick and choose the products you want to buy. However, remembering ingredient lists is a hassle, so we recommend checking out formulas on the EWG Skindeep website instead.</p><h3>Wand Design</h3><p>Your lash goals will give you great insight into picking the right mascara wand. If you want lengthened, separated, and well-defined lashes, try a thin brush or a brush made of plastic. If you prefer thick, volumized lashes, try a fat wand with natural bristles. Bonus tips: A curved wand makes it easier to apply just one or two coats of mascara, while a straight wand gives you more control over the application.</p><h3>Cost</h3><p>How much do you want to spend on your mascara? While a good product can easily cost you upwards of $30, you don’t have to pay more than $20 for an excellent drugstore mascara. Most of the time, you will pay around $10 for a standard-size tube. To keep costs down, we recommend comparing prices across multiple sites. (For example, one site may sell a product for a dollar less than other retailers.)</p><h2 class=section-title>What Are the Different Types of Drugstore Mascaras?</h2><h3>Waterproof</h3><p>Waterproof mascaras are oil-free formulas with hydrophobic ingredients (ingredients that repel water). They tend to last for eight hours or more and don’t smudge if you sweat, go under water, or rub your eyes. Of course, that staying power comes with a few consequences: Hydrophobic ingredients are harsh on lashes and may zap them of their natural moisture.</p><p>If you are going to wear a waterproof mascara, Sephora Beauty Director Myiesha Sewell <a href=#>recommends applying a mascara primer</a> first. “What this does is, one: It conditions your lashes,” she says. “Think about how your hair would feel if you never conditioned it ever … that’s how your lashes would feel. And [two]: It boosts the results of your mascara. I find if I do wear volumizing mascara, it gives me more volume. If I do wear lengthening mascara, my lashes really look shinier and healthier.”</p><h3>Tubing</h3><p>“Tubing mascara wraps each lash in water-resistant, tube-like polymers, like a little cap that washes off,” <a href=#>says makeup artist Caroline Barnes</a>. “If you don’t want the hassle of waterproof mascara which can be a pain to take off, Tubing mascara might be for you.” The benefits of tubing mascara include easy removal (just use warm water) and water resistance to cold water. It’s also a good in-between if you have sensitive eyes and can’t wear waterproof mascara, but still want a water resistant formula.</p><h3>Washable</h3><p>Washable mascaras are those that come off quickly at the end of the day. They don’t often contain hydrophobic ingredients, which repel water and increase staying power. However, manufacturers have gotten better at creating smudge and flake-resistant formulas that still rinse off easily. In other words, you don’t always have to live with smudging if you choose a washable formula.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW6w0a6erKyfp7JuucCsmpqqkah8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./buffalo-bills-damar-hamlin-released-from-hospital-after-collapse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Buffalo Bills Damar Hamlin Released From Hospital After Collapse</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zendaya-and-chrissy-teigen-lead-the-best-dressed-at-the-green-carpet-fashion-awards.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zendaya and Chrissy Teigen lead the best dressed at The Green Carpet Fashion Awards</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
