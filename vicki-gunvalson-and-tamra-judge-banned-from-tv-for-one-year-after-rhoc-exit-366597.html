And, a new report claims that neither Gunvalson or Judge will be allowed on television for one year because of the non-compete clause in their contracts.</p><p>According to Radar Online, Gunvalson and Judge are banned from TV for one year, and they will need special permission if they want to film another show.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7uSDKyFr7m/</p><p>The massive cast shakeup ahead of Season 15 came after both Gunvalson and Judge were demoted from their full-time status. Gunvalson was a “friend” of the show during Season 14, and she said at BravoCon in November that she’s “never coming back reduced again.”</p><p>Judge lost her full-time status at the end of Season 14, and Bravo offered her a “friend” role for three episodes at a rate of $20K per episode. The offer was a massive pay cut for Judge, who was making $900,000 per season as a full-timer.</p><p>When Gunvalson announced she was leaving RHOC, she wrote on Instagram that she will always be the OG of the OC, but it was time to say goodbye. She also revealed that she’s launching a new podcast titled Whooping It Up with Vicki.</p><p>Judge wrote on Instagram that it’s been a wild 12 years, but it was time for her to move on.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7wf_69JmKB/</p><p>An insider called Gunvalson’s departure from RHOC “the end of an era,” and she made it clear at BravoCon that she wouldn’t be back as a friend. As for Judge, executive producer Andy Cohen said that she’s been an incredible part of RHOC for 12 years, and the only thing he had to say about her was that fans have not seen the last of Judge on RHOC.</p><p>Another source said that Bravo wanted Judge to “be a bridge” during Season 15 from the old cast to the new, but Judge refused.</p><p>“Tamra got her pick-up contract letter last, after the other ladies, and it had major conditions in it,” said the insider. “She was even more than demoted to a friend role. She’d have very little camera time. And it meant she would earn next to nothing in reality TV terms.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>New episodes of Real Housewives of Orange County will return to Bravo later this year.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGemnrCstYygrKeukaHAsLqMmqWdZaSWurOtjKOsnZ%2BVYq%2Bius2em2aeoqS6bsDVZp2oql2ku6Z52J6Yq2WRm8Gmvoyrn6ibXZrFqsCMbG1vbWlsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charles-mcgonigal-wikipedia-married.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Charles McGonigal Arrested?
