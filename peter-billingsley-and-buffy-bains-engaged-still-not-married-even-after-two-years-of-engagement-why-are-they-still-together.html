Back in 2010, his bride-to-be opened up about her life in Chicago for a video posted on the Chicago Young Republican.</p><p>“I love the big city feel, even though it’s still manageable,” the Colorado native said at the time. “It’s still easy to meet people and get involved with things you want to get involved in.”</p><p>Bains also noted that she graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, and loves sailing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PTfWLZmiA9vl.jpg><p>Billingsley, meanwhile, has continued to work in Hollywood since his iconic role in the holiday fan favorite.

There has been no news about them since they got engaged. We are not sure at the moment if the couple is together or not.</p><p>There was the time they were together and in love which led them to get engaged in 2015 but even after the engagement which has already been almost 2 years haven’t yet gotten married makes it suspicious for us about their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4ad5094e2878c5035c5b9737268bd3f6_400x400.jpeg><p>Though Peter currently works as a Hollywood producer, director,&nbsp; and actor, he hasn’t hung up his black-framed glasses and bunny suit for good! Fans got to relive the holiday classic in 2010 when he brought his childhood role onto the stage for<strong> A Christmas Story: The Musical!.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">At the time he revealed,</a></p><p>“The film brings a lot of joy to a lot of people,”</p><p>Adding,</p><p>“I always get asked, ‘Aren’t you over it?’ But I’m not.”</p><p>The former actor even kept some of the memorabilia from the set.</p><p>“I still have the gun, and I sadly still have that bunny suit.”</p><p>We do not much information about the duo since they haven’t been in the limelight for a long time and have given any hint since the news of them being engaged. They have been successful in keeping their personal life private. We as a fan are wondering about the relationship.</p><p>Additionally, we hope that they are still together and going strong since we have limited information. We are happy to see them as a couple and hope they get married soon!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_Bio_on_Peter_Billingsley></span><span>Short Bio on Peter Billingsley</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Peter Billingsley&nbsp;is an American actor, director, and producer, known for his role as Ralphie in the 1983 movie <i>A Christmas Story</i> and as “Messy Marvin” in the Hershey’s Chocolate Syrup commercials during the 1970s.
