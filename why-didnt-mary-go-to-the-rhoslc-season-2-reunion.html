Why didn't Mary Cosby go to the reunion taping?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: BRAVO</span></figure><p>On Jan. 6, Andy Cohen, Bravo producer, and Housewives reunion show host sat down with the ladies of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City</a> to recap the highs and lows of the season. However, one cast member wasn’t present for the always-confrontational end-of-season event. In the past week, several media outlets have reported that <a href=#>RHOSLC</a> star <a href=#>Mary Cosby</a> did not appear on the Season 2 reunion special.</p><p>Andy also confirmed that she was a no-show he responded to a fan’s questions in his Instagram stories about if she had been there or not, and per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> wrote: “sadly no.” Missing the annual end-of-season showdown is a big no-no in The Real Housewives universe. Mary Cosby isn’t the first housewife to skip out on a reunion. In 2013, Adrienne Maloof didn't attend <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </a>Season 3 reunion after her cast member Brandi Glanville disclosed that she had a surrogate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: BRAVO</span></figure><p>Adrienne was not asked to come back as a full-time cast member for Season 4 after her reunion absence. RHOBH alum Lisa Vanderpump skipped out of the Season 9 reunion in 2019 but had already decided to leave the franchise. Also, Jacqueline Laurita from <a href=#>RHONJ </a>didn’t show up to her Season 3 reunion, but the network had made an exception for her during that time. <a href=#>Why didn't Mary partake in the reunion</a>? Will she be fired from the series? Keep reading to find out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why didn't Mary Cosby go to the 'RHOSLC' Season 2 reunion special?</h2><p>One of the most scandalous cast members in Season 2 of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake was Mary Cosby. On the show, Mary's biggest storylines involved her marriage to her step-grandfather, Robert Cosby, Jr., and the controversy surrounding her congregation at Faith Temple Pentecostal Church. An ongoing storyline on RHOSLC is that Mary has been accused of stealing money from members of the church, effectively ruining their lives.</p><p>Fellow castmate Lisa Barlow alleges that Mary caused her lat friend Camron Williams "religious trauma" and had scammed him out of $300,000. On camera, Lisa stated that he had told her that he'd mortgaged his house and given the money to Mary. A few days before the reunion, the 49-year-old fought with Twitter followers after an episode showed her once again referring to Jennie's eyes as "slanted" and her skin as having "yellow tones," as well as imitating her costar's Vietnamese accent.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: BRAVO</span></figure><p>Mary apologized on the show but later<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> tweeted</a> that she'll "never" tell Nguyen she's sorry.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, an insider told the media outlet that Mary didn't attend the reunion because she "did not want to confront the controversy surrounding her this season." The source explained, "She was terrified of getting grilled about her 'racist' comments made toward Jennie [Nguyen] and Jen [Shah]. She also did not want to discuss the accusations that she runs a cult."</p><p>The insider added that not taping the reunion "was the kiss of death for Mary" and that "she hardly has any alliances left in the cast, who hoped she would have shown up to the reunion to take accountability" for everything. A possible firing could be coming down the pipeline before production starts on Season 3 of RHOSLC.</p><p>It will be interesting to see what transpires when the reunion airs. Hopefully, we will get some clarification on why Mary didn't attend and if she'll be a part of Season 3.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City airs Sunday at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim6esXaKus8WMoKZmrJ9iwamxjKufqKucmHq0scCspqdlYmK%2FpsHNoqan</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miles-teller-didnt-eat-bread-drink-for-8-months-to-get-ripped-2015259.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miles Teller Didn't Eat Bread, Drink for 8 Months to Get Ripped</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mandie-taketa-biography-age-movies-and-boyfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mandie Taketa Biography: Age, Movies And Boyfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
