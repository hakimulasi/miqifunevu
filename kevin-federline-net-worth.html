Federline is most widely recognized for being the ex-husband of <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>.</p><p>In 2005, the duo produced and starred on the UPN reality series "Britney & Kevin: Chaotic." In 2006, Kevin released the studio album "Playing with Fire" and the singles "PopoZão," "Lose Control," and "Privilege."</p><p>Federline has guest-starred on several television series, including "The <a href=# title="Drew Carey Net Worth">Drew Carey</a> Show" (2001), "Will & Grace" (2002), "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (2006), and "One Tree Hill" (2008), and he appeared in the films "You Got Served" (2004), "The Onion Movie" (2008), and "American Pie Presents: The Book of Love" (2009).</p><h2 id=spousal-support><strong>Spousal Support</strong></h2><p>When Kevin and Britney first separated in 2008, it was reported that Britney would commence paying $20,000 per month in spousal support. It is believed that the amount was increased to $40,000 per month at some point years later. In 2019 Kevin requested the monthly support be upped to $60,000, claiming he did not make enough income to support their sons.&nbsp; They duo soon agreed to a new arrangement, but the final number was not revealed publicly.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Kevin Federline was born Kevin Earl Federline on March 21, 1978, in Fresno, California. His mother, Julie, was a former bank teller, and his father, Mike, was a car mechanic. When Federline was 8 years old, his parents divorced, and Kevin and his brother, Chris, moved to Carson City, Nevada, with Julie. Three years later, Kevin and Chris moved in with their father in Fresno. Federline dropped out of school during his freshman year and started performing with the Dance Empowerment nonprofit organization; he later earned his GED. Kevin went on work as a backup dancer for such artists as <a href=# title="Michael Jackson Net Worth">Michael Jackson</a>, Pink, Destiny's Child, and his future wife's ex-boyfriend, <a href=# title="Justin Timberlake Net Worth">Justin Timberlake</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-188391 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GettyImages-72216309-1.jpg alt="Kevin Federline Bling Bling" width=414 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-188391 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Federline Bling Bling /Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2001, Federline appeared as a dancer in two music videos, <a href=# title="Christina Milian Net Worth">Christina Milian</a>'s "AM to PM" and Pink's "Get the Party Started," then appeared in Britney's 2004 "My Prerogative" video and Weezer's 2008 "Pork and Beans" video. In 2005, he starred on the five-episode reality series "Britney & Kevin: Chaotic" and released his first single, "Y'All Ain't Ready." He released his first and only album, the critically-panned "Playing with Fire," in October 2006, and he later released the tracks "Rollin' V.I.P" (2007) and "Hollywood" (2016) and appeared on two Ya Boy tracks, "You Should" (2008) and "Expectations" (2016). In 2006, Kevin modeled Five Star Vintage clothing in ads for the Blue Marlin apparel company. From 2006 to 2007, he appeared on several episodes of "WWE Raw," even taking part in the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view event, and in January 2007, he defeated <a href=# title="John Cena Net Worth">John Cena</a> in the ring (with help from Umaga and Johnny Nitro). In 2007, Federline appeared in a commercial for Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company that aired during Super Bowl XLI. He competed on the reality series "Celebrity Fit Club" in 2010, then appeared on another weight-loss competition series, "Excess Baggage," in 2012.

They split up before Kaleb was born, and Kevin began dating Britney Spears. The couple became engaged in July 2004 after three months of dating, and they married on September 18th of that year. Federline and Spears weren't legally wed until October 6th because of a delay in the finalization of their prenuptial agreement. Kevin and Britney had two sons, Sean (born September 14, 2005) and Jayden (born September 12, 2006), before divorcing in July 2007. Though they initially agreed to 50-50 custody of their sons, Kevin later requested that it be changed to 70-30, and Britney lost physical custody in October 2007.</p><p>On January 3, 2008, police responded to "a custodial dispute regarding Britney Spears's children," which resulted in Spears being taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she seemed to be "under the influence of an unknown substance." After the incident, Federline ended up with sole legal and physical custody of Sean and Jayden. Britney had visitation rights, and court papers that were filed in July 2008 gave her more time with the children and stated that she must pay Kevin $20,000 per month in child support. The former couple later went back to 50-50 custody, and in August 2019, they formally changed the custody agreement to 70-30 custody in Federline's favor.</p><p>Kevin went on to marry Victoria Prince on August 10, 2013, and they have two daughters, Jordan (born August 15, 2011) and Peyton (born April 4, 2014). In 2013, the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Federline because he owed $57,615.39 in back taxes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6Cyt7XNZp2enJWnuaq6xGalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mani-ratnam.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mani Ratnam</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jaime-bergman-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jaime Bergman Net Worth 2024: Career, Earnings and Financial Success</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-soules-new-legal-team-argues-he-didnt-flee-the-scene-w479224.html>Chris Soules New Legal Team Argues He Didnt Flee the Scene</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dating-nakeds-david-worries-about-getting-aroused-by-natalie-w211616.html>Dating Naked's David Worries About Getting Aroused by Natalie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devyne-rensch-age-how-old-facts-to-know.html>Devyne Rensch Age: How Old?
